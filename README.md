* This is a **delivery management application** for logistic companies.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Logistics managers can track their shipments
  * Logistics managers can also access information for all their customers
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* It is named `LogiLink` as it aims to be the link between logistic managers and their deliveries
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[LogiLink Product Website](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp)**.
