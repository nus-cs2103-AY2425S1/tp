* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _ClubConnect_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* It is named ClubConnect because it was created as a way to streamline Computing Club's communication and organization.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ClubConnect Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-f09-1.github.io/tp/)**.
