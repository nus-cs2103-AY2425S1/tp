* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

* This is **a project aimed at helping financial consultants streamline their work.**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * managing clients (adding, deleting, viewing all clients)
  * managing transactions of clients (adding, deleting, viewing transactions for a client)
  * search features are also available for both clients and transactions in a case-insensitive form
* The project simulates a client management system for a desktop application (called _Clientell_) used for managing contact and transaction details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. 
  * It provides a **reasonably fast** way of accessing and inputting information, through CLI.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Clientell` because it was created to help financial consultants manage their clients and what they tell them.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Documentation Page](docs/Documentation.md)**.
