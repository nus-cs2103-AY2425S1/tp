* PlanPal is an **address book** designed for **student event planners** at NUS who need to manage contacts
  (e.g., attendees, vendors, sponsors, and volunteers) for their events.
* PlanPal offers a **centralized platform** to organize, track, and access contact information, ensuring 
  efficient coordination and smooth communication throughout the event planning process.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
