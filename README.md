* The product `NovaCare` targets healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, with the aim of optimizing patient care and task management.
* This application is designed to **improve efficiency** by providing a clear overview of patient information, critical tasks, and emergency contacts, reducing reliance on manual documentation.
* It is named `NovaCare`, a blend of "new" (Nova) and "care", symbolizing a fresh approach to managing patient information and tasks.
* `NovaCare` enhances patient care by **organizing and tracking critical data**, allowing healthcare personnel to prioritize their time and focus on urgent tasks. The system provides:
  * **Organized Patient Care**: Efficient management of patient information such as personal details, emergency contact details and priority.
  * **Task Management**: Nurses can add, track, and complete tasks like administering medication or checking vitals, ensuring no task is overlooked.
  * **Critical Insights**: A centralized dashboard displays patient data and task overviews, enabling quick identification of patients needing immediate attention.
