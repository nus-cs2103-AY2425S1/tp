* This is **a specialised address book for property agents who are fast typers**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Easily identify clients which are looking to sell their flats based on customisable tags
  * Manage prospective and existing customers by sorting them into different categories including housing type and income level using tags
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _PROperty_) used for managing contact details of the customers of property agents.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `PROperty` because we wanted the name to resonate with property agents.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[PROperty Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-f15-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
