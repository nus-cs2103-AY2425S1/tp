# Teacher's Pet (TP)

- **Teacher's Pet** is an application for NUS Teaching Assistants (TAs) to handle students' information with ease.
- **TP** utilizes a Command Line Interface (CLI) which improves the speed and efficiency of
handling administrative tasks.

## Features
- Add a student
- Edit a student
- Delete a student
- List all student
- Add a comment to students
- Randomized generator of a student name
- Filter students by name
- Filter students by class
- Give an attendance score to a student

## Example of Expected Usage
- **Tutor's Simplified Usage:**
  - As a tutor when I arrive to class, I can immediately start up the TP application
  - I can add any new students to my list of students.
  - I can then edit/delete/list and filter students based on the criteria I need.
  - I can give a cumulated attendance to the students in the class.
  - I can add comments to students. 
  - I can generate a random name to decide which student to call upon.
  - I can filter the list of students to find student by group or names.
  - At the end of class, I can close the application and on next use the data will be available as it is stored locally.

## Documentation
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the
**[Teacher's pet Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w10-1.github.io/tp/)**

## Naming & Origins
- The application is named **Teacher's Pet** (**TP** for short) to reflect its role in assisting TAs,
similar to a "teacher's pet."
- We developed this application as we saw a real inefficiency in how TAs were managing their students information,
with many still relying on pen and paper.
- TP will solve this inefficiency and improve the quality of life for TAs.

## Other Details
* The project builds on an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_),
which is used for managing contact details.
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC).
* It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).

## Acknowledgments
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
