* This is **an address book application targeted for private school teachers and educators**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as an effecient tool for educators to retrieve student/parents contact information
* The project builds on to enhance the software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Cher` because it aims to simplify the hectic life of teachers by offering features that are specifically targeted for them
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Cher Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w13-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
