# EduContacts

**EduContacts** is a desktop application designed for **tertiary teachers and educators** to manage contacts with 
students, parents, and faculty across multiple classes or educational years.

- It is optimized for those who prefer to work with a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the 
- benefits of a **Graphical User Interface** (GUI).
- It helps educators keep communication organized, track academic progress, and support parent-teacher interactions 
- efficiently, often across large groups.

## Value Proposition

An address book tailored for educators simplifies student and parent contact management, enhances communication 
tracking, and integrates progress reports, helping teachers save time and foster effective collaboration across the school community.

## Features

- **Class/Group-Based Contact Management**: Organize contacts by class, subject, or school year for easy access.
- **Parent-Teacher Communication Tracking**: Keep a history of messages or meetings with parents and faculty.
- **Student Progress and Grade Tracking**: Link contact information with student records and academic performance.
- **Event Scheduling and Reminders**: Integrate with school calendars to manage parent-teacher meetings, 
report deadlines, or school events.
- **Group Messaging**: Enable teachers to send messages to an entire class or group of parents at once, 
streamlining communication.
- **Custom Fields**: Add notes for individual students (e.g., learning accommodations, 
behavioral issues, or special needs).
- **Integration with School Management Systems**: Sync with platforms like Google Classroom or 
school LMS (Learning Management Systems).
