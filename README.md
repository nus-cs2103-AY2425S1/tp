# Teacher's Pet (TP)

- **Teacher's Pet** is an application for NUS Teaching Assistants (TAs) to handle students' information with ease.

## Documentation 
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the
**[Teacher's pet Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w10-1.github.io/tp/)**

## Naming & Origins 
- The application is named **Teacher's Pet** (**TP** for short) to reflect its role in assisting TAs,
similar to a "teacher's pet."
- We developed this application as we saw a real inefficiency in how TAs were managing their students information,
with many still relying on pen and paper.
- TA will solve this inefficiency and improve the quality of life for TAs.

## Other Details
* The application is named **Teacher's Pet** (`TP` for short) to reflect its role in assisting teachers,
similar to a "teacher's pet."
* The project builds on an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_),
which is used for managing contact details.
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC).
* It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).

## Acknowledgments
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
