VBook is a sleek, professional contact management app for programmers that value privacy and self hosting. Optimised for freelance software developers, this app combines Command Line Interfaces with professional contact management to give developers the contact book they deserve.<br>

* Programmers that value privacy and self hosting. Such programmers can include freelance software developers.

**Feature List (for now)**

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
