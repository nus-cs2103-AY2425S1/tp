* This is **an address book for social workers**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as an easy way to locate/contact families.
  * keep track of how long it has been since their last visit.

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _SocialBook_) used for managing contact details.

  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[SocialBook Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103-f10-2.github.io/tp)**.
