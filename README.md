## Acknowledgement
This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

* This is a project to help Pre-University home tuition teachers manage their contacts better.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Manage contacts of students and parents
  * Manage lesson schedules
  * Manage locations of lessons
* The project is an extension of an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `TutorEase` because it is created to easy the workload and problems of tutors.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TutorEase Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103-f11-2.github.io/tp/index.html)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
