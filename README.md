* TrueRental is **a team project for CS2103T-T15-1**.<br>
  Motivation:
  * Letting agents must manage many clients personal and property information, e.g. contact details, addresses, rent information, rent prices, tenant information, document storage, and automated reminders. There is too much information for letting agents to keep track of. Hence, our enhanced CLI tool can help them address these problems!
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TrueRental Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t15-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the **AddressBook-Level3 project** created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
