It provides fast access to employee, contractor, and candidate contact details, optimized for HR professionals who prefer a CLI. It allows quick updates, talent pool organization, and candidate tracking, all through a streamlined, command-based interface designed for speed and efficiency. It also helps with assignment of HR staff to HR events and cases.
