# MATER

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)



Welcome to MATER, a **desktop app designed for efficient management of client and vehicle information in vehicle workshops in Singapore**. MATER is specially optimised for users who prefer quick interactions through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) while benefiting from the powerful speed of command-based navigation for faster workflows.

### **Why MATER?**

Modern car workshops often face a variety of operational challenges:
- **Overwhelming client data**: Handling customer and vehicle information can be cumbersome and prone to errors without a dedicated system.
- **Poor record-keeping**: Relying on spreadsheets or paper records leads to inefficiencies, especially when managing vehicle histories, service issues, or specific vehicle details.
- **Slow task execution**: Traditional systems require multiple clicks and navigation steps, slowing down workshop efficiency.


### **Our Solution**

MATER was designed to address these challenges directly:
- **Centralised client management**: Keep all client and vehicle records in one place, reducing the chance of data duplication and simplifying access.
- **Streamlined command-based controls**: Users can type commands to perform tasks faster than by navigating through a typical GUI.
- **Reliable data tracking**: Track issues and maintenance details with consistency, ensuring no information is lost and that clients receive high-quality service.


### **Product Overview**

MATER offers a feature-rich platform with the following capabilities:
- **Client and Vehicle Management**: Store and organise clients' personal details, vehicle registration, and service history.
- **Quick Search and Filter Options**: Find clients and cars instantly by name or vehicle registration number.
- **Command Shortcuts**: Use simple, structured commands to add, edit, delete, or view client details with minimal steps.
- **Status Tracking**: Mark clients as checked in or out for better tracking of in-progress services.
- **Automatic Data Storage**: MATER saves all data automatically, minimising the risk of accidental data loss.


### **User Base**

MATER is designed for **small to medium-sized car workshop managers** and their team members who:
- **Need faster, streamlined data access** for client and vehicle information.
- **Prefer a hands-on approach** to managing their client lists with minimal steps.

Whether you're a workshop owner, a mechanic, or an administrative staff member responsible for managing records, MATER empowers you to achieve efficient, accurate, and consistent data handling with ease.
