* MedDict is **a project based on a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>

* The original project MedDict was based on simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.

* MedDict is a desktop application designed for physiotherapists who manage a large number of patients. It simplifies data entry and retrieval, allowing quick access to contact details, patient conditions, and the progress of recurring or long-term patients. The application supports a streamlined process for tracking medical history, patient appointments, and treatment progress.

* MedDict provides a specialized, all-in-one solution for physiotherapists to manage patient-related information, including medical history, treatment plans, and appointment tracking. The app is optimized for frequent use in clinical settings where speed and accuracy are essential.

* While MedDict offers a graphical interface, most user interactions happen using a Command Line Interface (CLI), tailored for physiotherapists who prefer typing over mouse interactions and prioritize efficiency in managing patient information.

* In other words, MedDict is formulated for physiotherapists who need quick and reliable access to patient information, prefer minimal time spent on data entry, and are comfortable using CLI-based apps for faster updates during consultations.

* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
* * This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
