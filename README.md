* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _NovaCare_) used for managing patient tasks and information.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* In this project, we create an application to assist nurses in keeping track of tasks and information, specific to each patient.
* It is named `NovaCare`, a blend of "new" (Nova) and "care", symbolizing a fresh approach to managing patient information and tasks.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[NovaCare Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-f15-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org). It is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
