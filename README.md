* Team: CS2103T-F13-2

* This is **our team's project for CS2103T Software Engineering (SE) Module**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details. Our goals are as follows:
  - Write code of **good coding quality** that **follows SOLID principles**.
  - Provide **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  - Develop code base with **good software engineering practices and workflows**.
* Our application is named `Address Book Command Line Interface` (`ABCLI` for short) as it is an address book that is operated primarily through a command line interface.
* We have tailored our application specifically for Real Estate Agents
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ABCLI Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-f13-2.github.io/tp/)**.
