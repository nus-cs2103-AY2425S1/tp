* **EZSTATES** is a contact-management application targeted at freelance real-estate agents.<br>
  Example usages:
  * User adds a buyer/seller
  * User deletes a buyer/seller
  * User tracks a listing
  * User deletes a listing
  * User sets an appointment
  * User deletes an appointment
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _EZSTATES_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[EZSTATE Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-f11-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
