## Git Workflow

This project uses
the [Feature Branch Flow](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/revisionControl.html#feature-branch-flow)
with rules set to protect the `master` branch. PRs are mandatory and at least 1 member requires review.

> Feature branches are branches being used to develop an individual story. They should be named "
> {issue-number}-{summary}" where "{issue-number}" is the issue number corresponding to the feature you are implementing
> and "{summary}" is a brief summary of the feature `formatted-like-this`.
