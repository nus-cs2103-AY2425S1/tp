**Product name: CareLink**.<br>

**Target User** <br>

Independent Geriatricians managing elderly patients with chronic conditions, someone who can type fast, prefers CLI over GUI, and often needs to manage several patients.

**Value Proposition** <br>

Existing software donâ€™t fulfill the needs of independent Geriatricians as they are either too generic or integrated into large hospital networks. They can be time consuming and not easy to use.

We specifically target Geriatricians by tailoring to the unique requirements of managing elderly patients, particularly when it comes to tracking multiple chronic conditions, coordinating care, and maintaining regular follow-ups.

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[CareLink Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t13-4.github.io/tp/)**.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
