* Hey! Are you a **private tutor** looking for an app to **save time**? why not try this one out!

* **GOATS is a desktop address book application built upon AddressBook Level 3, targeted towards private tutors to help manage student and parent contact information.**<br>
  * While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[GOATS Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t09-4.github.io/tp/)**.
