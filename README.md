# DocTrack
**DocTrack** is **a project done by Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>

## What is DocTrack?
* DocTrack helps general practitioners (GPs) at small clinics quickly access patient contact details, appointments, and treatment records. 
* It is optimized for users who prefer a command-line interface (CLI), enabling faster completion of frequent tasks through typed commands.

## More about it
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * For user and developer documentation**, head over to **[DocTrack Documentation](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w10-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)
