* This is **a project for wedding planners and event organizers**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point for planning and managing wedding-related contacts (photographers, venues, caterers, clients, etc.)
  * as a reference for organizing large-scale events with multiple stakeholders.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _PlanPerfect_) used for managing wedding planner contact details and tasks.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **well-structured** code base of **reasonable size** (around 6 KLoC), allowing for efficient development and extensibility, especially for intermediate-level SE students or developers.
  * It comes with **well-maintained user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `PlanPerfect` because it is primarily designed for wedding planners to organize important contacts and event-related information.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[PlanPerfect Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t12-2.github.io/tp)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
