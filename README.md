## What This is

_TAHub Contacts_ is a contact management app that helps them save time by having easy reference to their tutees' contact
details, while allowing quick view of other essential data related to the tutee such as grades, participation, GitHub
usernames when there is a need to contact them.

## Who This is For

A busy undergraduate Computer Science student, currently a Teaching Assistant (TA) of one or more classes,
with many commitments who is comfortable with a
command line interface, and faces a lack of time to keep track of his students' contact details.
