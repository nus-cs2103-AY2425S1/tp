## What is StoreClass?
* StoreClass is designed to be used by educators in private educational institutions such as tuition centers, allowing educators to quickly
access student information such as contact details, class details and other necessary information.
* It is optimized for users who are comfortable using the command-line interface (CLI), which allows for faster inputs through text-based inputs.

## Project Information
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
* It is named `StoreClass` as it is a play on words, stating how the class of students are stored.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[StoreClass Documentation](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w10-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
