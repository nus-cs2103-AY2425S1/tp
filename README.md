This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

**HallPointer** is a desktop application specifically designed for CCA (Co-Curricular Activity) leaders in NUS Halls to efficiently manage hall points and member participation. The application allows users to track attendance, allocate points, and maintain member details. While HallPointer features a GUI, most of the interactions are optimized for use with a Command Line Interface (CLI).
