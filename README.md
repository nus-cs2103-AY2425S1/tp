InternBuddy is a desktop application used for managing contact details.

## Target user
> This product is for university students studying a STEM major, specifically those seeking summer internships. They are typically busy with assignments while applying for summer internships. As a result, they may lose track of key information about companies they have applied for in a constantly increasing list of applications made.

## Value proposition
> InternBuddy aims to simplify and efficiently manage internship application details, optimised for fast typers who prefer a CLI interface. It enables users to track key information such as HR contacts, interview dates, and application statues, all while maintaining portability across multiple operating systems without requiring a remote server.

## Acknowledgements
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `AddressBook Level 3` (`AB3` for short) because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
