# [CS2103-F13-1] SpleetWaise

> SpleetWaise builds on [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) - **a desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still offering the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). _Designed to streamline expense tracking for students_, SpleetWaise makes it easy to record and monitor both personal and shared expenses with contacts saved in the address book. With features to keep track of balances with friends, it eliminates the confusion often associated with managing shared costs, providing a clear, organised view of who has owes what. If you can type fast, SpleetWaise lets you handle your contact and expense management tasks more efficiently than traditional GUI apps, offering students a stress-free way to manage their expenses and shared balances with contacts.

> **Target User**: University students based in Singapore looking to track transactions with saved contacts.

## Git Workflow

This project uses the [Feature Branch Flow](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/revisionControl.html#feature-branch-flow) with rules set to protect the `master` branch. PRs are mandatory and at least 1 member requires review.

> Feature branches are branches being used to develop an individual story. They should be named "{issue-number}-{summary}" where "{issue-number}" is the issue number corresponding to the feature you are implementing and "{summary}" is a brief summary of the feature `formatted-like-this`.
