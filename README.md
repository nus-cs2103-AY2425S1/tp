# WedLinker :man_in_tuxedo::bride_with_veil:

## Overview
This is **WedLinker**, a desktop application designed for **professional wedding planners** to seamlessly manage a variety of
vendors and clients across different locations for a wedding.<br>

While the application has a GUI, most of the user interactions happens using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
This allows for **efficient** and **streamlined management** of **wedding-related contacts** through text-based commands.

WedLinker provides a centralised address book that simplifies the complexities of coordinating multiple vendors,
venues and clients. It enhances communication and streamlines event planning tasks, making the wedding planning process
more organised and efficient.

## Value proposition
Designed with the unique demands of wedding planners in mind, WedLinker helps you:

- Organise and manage contacts, including vendors, clients and guests.

- Track wedding details, including the date, address and partners of each wedding.

- Consolidate and track vendor tasks, ensuring no task is left incomplete.
