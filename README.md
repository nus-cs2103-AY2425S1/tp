LegacyLink is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, LegacyLink can get your
contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* The User Guide and Developer Guide can be found [here](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t10-4.github.io/tp/index.html).
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
