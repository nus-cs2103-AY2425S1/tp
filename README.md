## EduTuTu - Address Book to manage students' information :man_student:

* EduTuTu is a desktop application for managing contacts.
* EduTuTu aims to help tuition centers that need organized and efficient communication between **teachers, students, and parents**.
* EduTuTu is customized for tuition centres to manage their students' information.
* EduTuTu is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* Whether youâ€™re updating parents about class schedules, sharing student progress reports, or coordinating with teachers, this tool simplifies the process, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
