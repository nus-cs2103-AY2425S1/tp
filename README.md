* This is **a project built by Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* The project is an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _MediContacts_) used for receptionists at clinics to manage patient contacts and appointments.
  * It is designed for those who prefer CLI over GUI and have to deal with numerous patients' records and staff particulars, while being visually organised.
  * Enables users to manage information of relevant personnel in the clinic and patients, as well as appointments.

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[MediContacts Product Website](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t09-3.github.io/tp/)**.
