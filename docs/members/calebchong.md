### Caleb's Profile

I will be working on developing a desktop application called BizBook Pro.
BizBook Pro is an enhancement to the existing Address Book Level 3 desktop application used 
for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, 
and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

* **About Me**: I enjoy watching movies and listening to music during my free time.
