### Project: WedLinker

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
WedLinker is based on that, meant specifically for wedding planners to store important and relevant contacts, with features necessary for wedding planners.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
