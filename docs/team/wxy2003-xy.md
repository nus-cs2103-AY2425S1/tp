### Project: RealConnect

RealConnect is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Real Connect can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added log command that allows the user to record activities engaged with clients (Pull Requests [\#53](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/53))

* **New Feature**: Added favourite command that allows users to label contacts as favourite, as well as sorting all contacts in the list by favourite. (Pull Requests [\#73](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/73))

* **New Feature**: Added remark command that allows users to give modifiable remark to contacts in the addressbook. (Pull Requests [\#2](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/2) [\#51](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-2/tp/pull/51))
