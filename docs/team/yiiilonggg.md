### Project: BlitzBiz

BlitzBiz is a desktop contact management application used for small business owners to keep track of key contacts. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Project management**:
  * Assisted with the timely management of releases of the product
  * Assisted with value proposition of the product
  * Assisted with deciding features to develop in line with the value proposition

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Created `schedule` field: Users can add a flexible schedule name, schedule date and optional schedule time to a contact
  * Created `schedule` command: Users can change details of a schedule or clear a schedule from a person
  * Assisted with `filter` command: Initialised the structure of the code to filter for a single tag. Command was later expanded to filter for multiple tags
  * Assisted with `add` command: Relaxation of command to allow users to add a contact that has at least one of phone, email, address or a social media handle

* **Documentation**:
  * Restructured User Guide, segmenting the features into various use cases.
  * Add hyperlinks throughout User Guide to make it more navigable
