### Project: AddressBook Level 3

GRUB is a quick and efficient solution to search for local dining options, tailored to personal preferences. The user interacts with it using a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter restaurants with tag names.
  * What it does: Allows the user to filter through the list of restaurants by finding specific tag names.
  * Justification: This feature is great for finding set of restaurants given a specific common criteria rather than just its name, for example cuisine types.
  * Pull Requests: [\#96](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/pull/96)

* **New Feature**: Added dark theme switch.
  * What it does: Allows the user to toggle the UI with dark and light theme.
  * Justification: This feature is great for users that have preferences to how bright they would prefer their screen and applications to be.
