### Project: WedLinker

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
WedLinker is based on that, meant specifically for wedding planners to store important and relevant contacts, with features necessary for wedding planners.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Filter tag
  * What it does: allows the user to filter contacts based on their tags.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a wedding planner might want to find florists.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
* **Community**:
  * Contributed to forum discussions
