### Project: SeeRee 2.0

SeeRee 2.0 is a combination of desktop address book and a scheduler for meetings application. The user interacts with
it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `add-schedule`
  * What it does: allows the adding of events to the schedule.
  * Justification: a schedule needs events.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=QuekBingHeng&sort=groupTitle%20dsc&sortWithin=title&since=2024-09-20&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false)
