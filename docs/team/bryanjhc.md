# About Me

Hey there homies! 👋 I'm Bryan Chew, a Year 2 Computer Science undergraduate at the
National University of Singapore (NUS) with a passion for solving real-world problems through technology and digitalisation.

## My Journey 🚀

My interest in technology began when I had my first taste of menial and tedious low level tasks (chores).
When I searched online on how to escape my chores, I stumbled upon the concept of automation and was
fascinated by the idea of automating tasks.

## What have I done in NUS? 🛠️
During my time at NUS, I led the development of **UriNUS**, a community-driven mobile app that enhances public
hygiene awareness, which earned **Apollo 11 level recognition** in the Orbital program.

I have also participated in the **NUS Hack&Roll** hackathon and emerged as a top 8 winner along with my team.
Our Project was **NUStlers** a mobile app that allowed students to buy food from other students who were already in
line at food stalls.

## Experience 💼

- 🏆 **Hack&Roll Winner**: I was part of a team that developed an innovative project during NUS Hack&Roll.
- 👨‍🏫 **Teaching Assistant**: As a TA for **CS1101S Programming Methodology 1**, I helped facilitate in-class discussions, provided feedback on assignments, and supported students in their learning journey.
- 📱 **Mobile & Web App Development**: Through NUS Orbital, I gained hands-on experience developing both mobile and web apps, tackling real-world problems with technology.

## Interests 🎯

I am currently focusing on **Machine Learning** and **Backend Software Development**, applying for internship positions at **TikTok** in 2025 for the roles of Machine Learning Engineer Intern (Trust & Safety) and Backend Software Engineer Intern, Global Architecture.

## Projects 💡

- **UriNUS**: A React Native app aimed at improving public hygiene by providing real-time information about restrooms across campus. The project is community-driven and designed to enhance cleanliness and convenience for users. We are looking to expand the app nationwide in Singapore.

## Skills & Technologies 🔧

- **Languages**: Java, Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: React Native, Expo
- **Databases**: SQL, Supabase
- **Tools**: Git, Vercel, Visual Studio Code
