### Project: T_Assistant

T_Assistant is a **desktop app for CS2103 tutors managing their students, groups and tasks** optimized for use via a
Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, T_Assistant can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Enhancements implemented**:
    * **New Feature [#62](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/62)** : Added Task class
        * <u>What it does</u>: Base implementation of Task class, Deadline class and status enum.
        * <u>Highlight</u>: Deadline class uses strict resolving and `uuuu` for year to deal with common invalid dates.
    * **New Feature [#74](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/74)** : Added Delete Group Command
        * <u>What it does</u>: Deletes Group from T_Assistant. Also updates Student and Tasks related to the Group
          deleted.
    * **Refactored UI [#102](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/102)**: Updates the details shown in
      Student and Group Panels
        * <u>What it does</u>: Adds group label in Student Panel and reformat list of students in each Group.
        * <u>Why do this</u>: Improves UX so that user does not have to switch between panels to see information.
    * **Refactored Feature** [#121](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/121): Improve logic when loading
      Students from `addressbook.json`
        * <u>What it does</u>: Adds a special character that denotes a student has no group.<br>Updated Student class
          structure to use `Optional<GroupName>` rather than `Optional<Group>`
        * <u>Why do this</u>: Reduces number of places to update fields when commands are run.
    * **New Feature [#143](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/143)**: Added shorthand for all commands
        * <u>Why do this</u>: Command words were getting a bit long as features were added so adding shorthand will
          allow users to be able to quickly use commands once they are familiar with them.
    * **New Feature [#168](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/168), [#169](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/169), [#171](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/171)**: Added Find Student, Group and Task commands
        * <u>What it does</u>: Allows user to search each list of objects
        * <u>Challenges</u>: Initial implementation attempted to use [FuzzyWuzzy](https://github.com/xdrop/fuzzywuzzy),
          however, due to challenges in getting consistent results, reverted back to using `String.contains()`.
    * **Refactored Feature [#197](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/197)**: Update command word matching
      to be case-insensitive
        * <u>What it does</u>: Allows user to type in command words in any case.
    * **Refactored Feature [#198](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/198), [#272](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/272)**: Update relevant comparators to be case-insensitive
        * <u>Why do this</u>: Makes more sense for the updated parameters to be case-insensitive due to their respective
          natures and use cases.
    * **New Feature [#227](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/227)**: Added Add Existing Task to Groups
        * <u>What it does</u>: Allows user to add pre-existing tasks to new groups.
        * <u>Why do this</u>: User might add groups after creation of tasks, this allows them to assign tasks to groups
          without recreating them.
    * **Refactored Class [#272](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/272)**: Updated GroupName parsing
        * <u>What it does</u>: Updates GroupName regex to accept only names in formats of group for CS2103/T.
        * <u>Why do this</u>: Since T_Assistant is built for TAs of CS2103, it makes sense that GroupName should respect
          the course's naming for groupings.
    * **Refactored Class [#272](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/272)**: Updated Deadline parsing
      error messages
      * <u>What it does</u>: Gives more information on what user inputted deadline has
      * <u>Challenges</u>: Due to inexperience with `DateTimeException`, unable to give more verbose error.
        See [#264](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/issues/264)
    * **Refactored Feature [#291](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/291)**: Add Existing Task to Group
      Command error messages
        * <u>What it does</u>: Informs user of which part of their command went wrong.
        * <u>Why do this</u>: Since the function can take in multiple groups, it is likely the user might mistype
          certain group names or add duplicates, this allows them to see where they went wrong.
    * **Bug Fix [#308](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/308)**: Fixed Groups not appearing in `lt` after
      mark command is ran
        * <u>Bug description</u>: Groups were being filtered away due to mark command returning a filtered list.
    * **Bug Fix [#330](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/330)**: Fixed Edit Group command not updating
      `Optional<GroupName>` for Students inside the Group
    * **Bug Fix [#336](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/pull/336)**: Fixed `setTask()` method in Group class
      to not take in index
        * <u>Bug description</u>: Index supplemented was based on global task list, which did not correspond to the
          index the task is located at within the Group.
        * <u>Fix</u>: Updated method to search for original Task before replacing it with the new one.
