### Project: TalentConnect

TalentConnect is a desktop address book application optimized for solo freelancer recruiter. It is brownfield project adapted from [AddressBook Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add jobs.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add representations of jobs into the address book.
  * Justification: Jobs are tied to companies, and so recruiters inevitably
    have to work with companies as well. Adding jobs to the address book
    allows recruiters to manage companies associated to their job listings and
    contacts, and enhance their existing workflow.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete jobs.
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete a job listing for when the job itself is no longer valid.
  * Justification: This helps to ensure that the displayed list of jobs only reflect those that are currently open. Future more, when jobs are no longer valid,
  contacts matched to them are automatically unmatched to signal to users that these contacts are freed up to be matched to other jobs.
