### Project: TalentConnect

TalentConnect is a desktop address book application optimized for solo freelancer recruiter. It is brownfield project adapted from [AddressBook Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add jobs.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add representations of jobs into the address book.
  * Justification: The jobs are required so that users can see what job openings are available for the contacts that they have, aiding in their decision to match a job to a contact.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete jobs.
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete a job listing for when the job itself is no longer valid.
  * Justification: This helps to ensure that the displayed list of jobs only reflect those that are currently open. Future more, when jobs are no longer valid,
  contacts matched to them are automatically unmatched to signal to users that these contacts are freed up to be matched to other jobs.
