### Project: GOATS

GOATS is a desktop address book application built upon AddressBook Level 3, targeted towards private tutors/tutors working at small tuition centres to manage student and parent contact information. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
