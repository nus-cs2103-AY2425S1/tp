### Project: Prudy

Prudy is an application to help Prudential financial agents help manage their clients. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * What it does: Adds a policy for a client
  * Justification: As an application for managing clients' policies, adding a policy is a requirement.
  * Highlights: Created the `policy` package.

* **New Feature**:
  * What it does: Made the `resultDisplay` in `Ui` to be expandable.
  * Justification: Some command results have long description. Being able to expand the display enhance readability.
  * Highlights: Researched on `JavaFX`.

* **Code contributed**:
  * Created majority of the `policy` package, including `Policy`, `PolicySet`, `PremiumAmount`, `CoverageAmount`, `ExpiryDate`, `LifePolicy`, `HealthPolicy`, `EducationPolicy`.
  * Ensured `Client`, `Policy` and `Claim` are immutable to shield them from external changes.

* **Project management**:
  * Reviewed and approved a few pull requests.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Polish the Ui.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Designed the UI mockup for Prudy
    * Polished the user guide, ensuring the document is free of typos
    * Ensured clarity of user guide
  * Developer Guide:
    * Updated UML diagrams
    * Ensured developer guide does not deviate from actual implementation

* **Community**:
  * Create new issue labels of `type`, `priority`, and `severity` and new milestones `v1.1` - `v1.6`.

* **Tools**:
  *
