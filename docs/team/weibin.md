### Project: BridalBuddy

BridalBuddy is a streamlined, command-line-based tool designed specifically for wedding planners who work best with fast, keyboard-centric operations. Instead of navigating complex and cluttered GUIs, BridalBuddy offers you a clean and efficient way to manage everything about the wedding, from guest lists to vendor contacts, all through a simple command-line interface.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
