### Project: Dream Day Designer

Dream Day Designer is a desktop application that targets wedding planners, aiming to help them manage clients and vendors through an effective address book at once. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Wrote 1 cool command
  * What it does: Something cool.
  * Justification: Makes the app cooler.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
