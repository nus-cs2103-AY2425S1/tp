### Project: GRUB

GRUB is a quick and efficient solution to search for local dining options, tailored to personal preferences. The user interacts with it using a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to rate restaurants.
  * What it does: Allows the user to set and remove their ratings.
  * Justification: This feature promotes a community-driven feedback loop that enhances trust and credibility in restaurant reviews. It benefits tourists and foodies by helping them make better-informed dining choices based on aggregated ratings, while also encouraging restaurant quality improvement through user feedback.
  * Pull Requests: [\#98](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F12-3/tp/pull/98)

* **New Feature**: Added Storage Safety
  * What it does: Resets the `addressbook.json` to the seeded data when it is empty.
  * Justification: This features simulates real-world scenario and is it also act as a backup for users and testers in the case when they performed `clear`.
