### Project: EventTory

EventTory is a Java Project adapted from [Address Book Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/).

EventTory simplifies the process of organizing events, from small gatherings to large-scale corporate functions, and is optimized for users who prefer a CLI-like interface. EventTory provides them with the ability to track event details and contact information for various vendors, allowing them to manage the status of multiple events concurrently.
