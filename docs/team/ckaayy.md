### Project: Prudy

Prudy is an application to help Prudential financial agents manage their clients. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Claims and Policy Management Commands
  * What it does: Provides CLI commands for managing claims and policies within Prudy.
  * Justification: Claims and policy management are crucial for financial agents to efficiently track client claims, view policies, and manage expiring policies, all from a unified platform.

* **Code contributed**:
  * Implemented parsing and logic for `list-expiring-policies`, `list-claims`, `list-policies`, `add-claim`, and `delete-claim`.
  * Created respective parser classes for each of these commands to handle input parsing and validation.
  * Added comprehensive test code for all the classes I have created

* **Project management**:
  * Managed GitHub milestones and labels, tagging PRs and issues with labels for severity, type, and priority.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Mainly focused on development of new features.


* **Documentation**:
  * **User Guide**:
    * Structured the main User Guide outline to enhance readability and navigation, creating comprehensive tables for all flags, arguments, and commands.
    * Added a command overview section and detailed descriptions for each command.
    * Reformatted notes, info and warning boxes for greater readability

  * **Developer Guide**:
    * Added user stories and updated Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs).
    * Enhanced the manual testing section and UML diagrams.
    * Formatted the Developer Guide to ensure consistency and clarity.

* **Community**:
  * Reviewed multiple PRs with non-trivial comments

* **Tools**:
  * Assisted in configuring project settings in IntelliJ IDEA to standardize development across the team.
  * Utilized PlantUML for creating detailed class diagrams used in the Developer Guide.
