### Project: HireMe

HireMe is a **desktop application for managing internship applications, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, HireMe can get your internship tracking tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: List all internship applications.
    * What it does: Allows the user to view all internship applications they had added in HireMe.
    * Justification: This is a necessary feature for the HireMe application to reset the searches and filters and view the original list of internship applications.

* **New Feature**: Filter through all internship applications by status.
    * What it does: Allows the user to filter through all internship applications by status of pending, accepted or rejected.
    * Justification: This feature is nice-to-have as it allows users to easily find a group of internship application of specified status.
