### Project: Data coNdUctorS

Data coNdUctorS - is a desktop address book application for managing contact details of members in NUS Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) groups.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2024-09-20&tabOpen=true&tabType=zoom&zA=WinstonJin&zR=AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&zACS=228.93682906688687&zS=2024-09-20&zFS=&zU=2024-11-12&zMG=false&zFTF=commit&zFGS=groupByRepos&zFR=false)

* **Project management**:
    * Managed release `v1.5` (1 release) on GitHub and wrote the release notes for it
    * Helped distribute the workload for different milestones, and release notes for `v1.1`, `v1.2`, `v1.3` and `v1.4`
    * Helped schedule Zoom calls and provided my own Zoom link for meetings
    * Was the main person reviewing PRs and merging them. Although it may not seem as I added non-trivial comments, I usually messaged them about it to request further explanation before accepting and merging

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Added extra  `help` commands such as `help list`, `help add` etc as well as the HelpParserCommand (Pull request [\#165](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/165))
    * Changed `Phone Number` to `Telegram Handle` to support our aim of data coNdUctorS (Pull request [\#53](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/53))
    * Added preliminary changes to the `edit` command (Pull request [\#97](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/97))
    * Refined and added JUnit test cases to reach the CodeCov criteria of 75%

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added `Table of Contents` (Pull requests [\#326](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/326))
        * Added `FAQs` and `Known Issues` (Pull request [\#362](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/362))
    * Developer Guide:
        * Overhauled the DG and added `User Stories`, `Use Cases`, `Manual Testing` and `Planned Enhancements` (Pull request [\#317](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/317))
        * Added `Glossary`, `Non-functional Requirements` and `Table of Contents` (Pull request [\#318](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/pull/318))

* **Learning Points**:
    * As a student with a Second Major in Computer Science, I think I really enjoyed the CS2103 experience, and although the workload is quite high, experiencing how a software development team operates in a controlled environment was quite a huge eye-opener for me
    * I really enjoyed that the syllabus incorporated how to use GitHub as I would never properly learned it in my main Engineering major. So now if I want to do further projects with GitHub or build off of people's open-source code I can for my own projects
    * I enjoyed the use of IntelliJ, learning it at a more in-depth. Previously in CS2030, I just used vim on my terminal and only in CS2040 I started using IntelliJ but at a very rudimentary level
    * Learning various other things like JavaFX and how to edit GUIs was also really cool albeit difficult to pick up at the start. But it was an enjoyable experience
    * Overall, I think that I didn't do as much as I could for this project (due to family reasons) but I believe I have learned everything that there could be from this module and I am truly grateful for our Profs, especially Dr Damith for establishing such an amazing module.
