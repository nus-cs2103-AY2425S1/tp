### Project: SeeRee 2.0

SeeRee 2.0 is a combination of desktop address book and a scheduler for meetings application. The user interacts with
it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `add-schedule`
  * What it does: allows the editing of events to the schedule.
  * Justification: a schedule needs events to be editable.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=tata32000)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.0.0 - v1.2.0` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Added testing utils class like MeetingBuilder and TypicalMeetings for testing the new schedule feature.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the features `edit-schedule`.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `edit-schedule` feature.
