## Project: CareLink

CareLink is a desktop address book application targeted towards independent Geriatricians managing elderly patients with chronic conditions, someone who can type fast, prefers CLI over GUI, and often needs to manage several patients.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### V1.3

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find a patient or caregiver based on the given NRIC [\#71](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/issues/71)
  * What it does: allows the user to find 1 or more person by using their NRIC.
  * Justification: This feature enables the doctor to quickly retrieve the records of a patient using their NRIC.
  * Highlights: This is an enhancement to the already existing find feature which finds person based on their names. This addition features quicker retrieval by using a person's unique NRIC.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the Parser to incorporate a new NRIC field [\#62](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/62)

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the FindNric feature


### V1.4
* **New Feature**: Added new User Interface for Find Command [\#106](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/issues/106)
  * What it does: Provides a comprehensive list of details for the person being found
  * Justification: This feature enables the doctor to view all details of a patient or caregiver
  * Highlights: This is an enhancement to the existing list which provides brief details on all persons.
