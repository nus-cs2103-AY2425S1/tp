### Project: TalentConnect

TalentConnect is a desktop address book application for freelancer third-party
recruiters, with functionality to enhance the recruitment management experience.
This includes matching job listings to candidates and tagging successful candidates
to companies for billing.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add companies into the address book.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add representations of companies into the
  address book.
  * Justification: Jobs are tied to companies, and so recruiters inevitably
  have to work with companies as well. Adding companies to the address book
  allows recruiters to manage companies associated to their job listings and
  contacts, and enhance their existing workflow.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required the team to consider the predicate 
  to a company being unique and how companies will interact with jobs and
  contacts in the address book.
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list all companies in the address book.
  * What it does: Allows the user to list all companies stored in the address book.
  * Justification: Companies need to be easily shown to recruiters for them to
  include companies and company-related features into their workflow.
  * Highlights: The structure of the address book's GUI had to be debated when
  the company list was added.
* **New Feature**: Added the integration between companies and jobs.
  * What it does: Tags jobs to a company when a job is created, and deletes
  all jobs tagged to a company when the company is deleted.
  * Justification: A job has to come from a company, so the constraint that
  jobs must be tagged to a company already existing in the address book should
  be followed. This facilitates other features that require the association 
  between a job and a company to enhance a recruiter's workflow.
  * Highlights: This enhancement had to be done in a non-conventional way due
  to how the address book is saved, and was the subject of quite a few discussions
  as to how to handle the integrations.
