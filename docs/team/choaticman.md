### Project: HireMe

HireMe is a **desktop application for managing internship applications, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, HireMe can get your internship tracking tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Statuses for internship applications.
  * What it does: allows the user to mark internship applications as `PENDING`, `ACCEPTED` or `REJECTED`.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user should be able to track the outcomes of the applications.


* **New Feature**: UI for internship applications' statuses.
  * What it does: allows the user to see the statuses of the internship applications. The statuses are coloured coded for easier identification.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user should be able to see the statuses of the applications easily.
  * Highlights: Any modification to any status will be reflected in real time in the UI.
