### Project: TalentConnect

TalentConnect is a desktop address book application optimized for solo freelancer recruiter. It is
brownfield project adapted from [AddressBook Level 3](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/). The
user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

  * What it does: When a user selects a company from the list, they can view detailed information about the associated candidates and open job listings related to that company, providing a comprehensive view of all connections within the app.
