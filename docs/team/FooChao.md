### Project: SellSavvy

SellSavvy helps independent sellers/dropshipping business owners manage detail of their clients and orders. It is optimized for CLI users so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list all orders under a customer in GUI.
  * What it does: allows User to view all the orders under a customer.
  * Justification: This feature allows user to keep track of the orders under each customer.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
