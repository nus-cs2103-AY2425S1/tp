### Project: DocTrack

**DocTrack** helps general practitioners (GPs) at small clinics quickly access patient contact details, appointments, and treatment records. It is optimized for users who prefer a command-line interface (CLI), enabling faster completion of frequent tasks through typed commands.

- Implemented the `DeleteAppointmentCommand` 
- Added a `Status` attribute in the `Person` class
- Modified the `Sickness` and `Medicine` attributes to be optional in the `Appointment` class
- Updated the `FindPersonCommand` to search for a person by name
- Added tests for the above changes
- Created tests for `AppointmentBookStorage`
- Updated the format of the User Guide and Developer Guide to ensure consistency
- Updated the contents of the User Guide and Developer Guide to ensure accuracy
