### Project: AddressBook Level 3

GRUB is a quick and efficient solution to search for local dining options, tailored to personal preferences. The user interacts with it using a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark and un-mark restaurants as favourites
  * What it does: Allows the user to mark specific restaurants as favourites, which then appear at the top of the restaurant list and highlighted.
  * Justification: This feature enables users to prioritise their preferred restaurants, making it easy to access frequently visited spots. Having favourites at the top adds convenience for users who regularly check certain restaurants.
  * Highlights: The implementation includes visual indicators for favourite restaurants and automatically re-sorts the list when a restaurant is marked or unmarked as a favourite. The GUI was updated to visually highlight favourites for quick identification.

* **New Feature**: Added sorting functionality to the Add, Edit, and Favourite commands
  * What it does: Ensures that the restaurant list is sorted alphabetically with favourite restaurants appearing at the top after any addition, edit, or favourite action.
  * Justification: This feature improves the user experience by keeping the list well-organized and ensuring that favourites are easy to access without additional user actions to re-sort.
  * Highlights: Sorting is seamlessly integrated with existing commands.
