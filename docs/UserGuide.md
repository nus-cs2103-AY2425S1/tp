## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

   - If you are on MacOS do note you may need to download a specific JDK 17 version. More on this [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html#programming-language).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-4/tp/releases/tag/V1.6).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your GoonBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar goonbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.

   <br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

   Examples:

   - cd /users/desktop/goonbook/goonbook.jar

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   - `list` : Lists all students.

   - `add n/Song Si Mew c/W08 p/10110011 t/Japanese` : Adds a student named `Song Si Mew` to the GoonBook.

   - `delete 1` : Deletes the 1st student shown in the current list.

   - `clear` : Deletes all students.

   - `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Layout

When you launch GoonBook, GoonBook appears on your screen as a Graphical User Interface, or GUI. Let’s look at the layout of the different components of GoonBook.

GoonBook’s GUI consists of a single main window, as well as the Help Window. The main window consists of three components:

1. Student List Box
2. Group List Box
3. Command Input and Output Boxes

The following picture of the main window shows the three components, numbered accordingly:
![Layout](images/Layout.png)

Besides the main window, GoonBook also has the Help Window. It is not part of the main GUI and is only shown after a [Help Command](#viewing-help--help) is run.

---

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

![Export](images/Export.png)


### Exported csv data file location

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

## Data Management

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the GoonBook.

Format: `clear`

![Clear](images/Clear.png)

**Warning:** The `clear` command has no confirmation prompt and will delete all data immediately. Use with caution.

## Exiting the Program

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

**Note:** Always exit the application using the `exit` command to ensure all data is saved properly.

### Saving the data

GoonBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

GoonBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**Warning:** Manually editing the data file may lead to data loss if the JSON format is not strictly followed. Always back up your data before making direct edits.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, GoonBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the GoonBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

- Import and Export feature to include Group support.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous GoonBook home folder.
**Q**: Is there support for importing and exporting groups?<br>
**A**: It is a planned enhacement. Do check out our Developer Guide for more information.
**Q**: I don't understand what caused the error in my command what can I do?<br>
**A**: Take note of the command you tried using and look at the command format and examples in the user guide.

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **If you require use of special characters**, unfortunately we currently support alphanumeric representations hence, special characters cannot be used in our application. However we will be adding support for this in future implementations as we understand some students or classes may require use of special characters.
4. **If you are trying to identify a specific student using find** but cannot explicity just return that single student due to them having a space in their name, we understand this can be a problem. Our team will be adding support for more specific searches to more accurately and preciesly locate students.
5. **Index isn't referencing the correct number**, index for our commands reference the currently displayed list of students and not the entire student list. Thus, it will be the index or number you see on you screen.
