## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your UniVerse application.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar UniVerse.jar` command
   to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Ui" style="width: 90%;">

5. Type the command in the command box and press **Enter** to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing **Enter** will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    - `list`: Lists all contacts.
    - `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 u/NUS m/Computer Science b/13-12-2003`:
      Adds a contact named **John Doe** to UniVerse.

      <box type="info" seamless>
      
      **Note**: The `add` command supports **optional fields** such as:
        - `w/WORK_EXPERIENCE`: Specifies past work or internships (e.g., `w/Intern,Google,2023`).
        - `i/INTEREST`: Adds interests to a contact (e.g., `i/Photography`).
        - `t/TAG`: Tags to label the contact (e.g., `t/friends`).
      
      </box>

      These fields can be added to make contact information more detailed. Here’s an example with optional fields included:
      ```markdown
       add n/Alice Tan p/91234567 e/alice@example.com a/Blk 123 Clementi Ave 3, #05-10 u/NTU m/Engineering b/15-04-2000 w/Intern,Google,2023 i/Photography t/friend
      ```

    - `addi in/1 i/Reading`:
      Adds an interest called **Reading** to the contact at index 1.
    - `findu u/NUS`: Finds all contacts studying at **NUS**.
    - `findi i/Swimming`: Finds all contacts whose interests include **Swimming**.
    - `exit`: Exits the app.
   

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Note that name cannot include prefixes that are already part of our commands.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Work experience parameter `[w/WORK_EXPERIENCE]` can only be used one time. <br>

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Data Management

### Saving the data

UniVerse data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

UniVerse data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/UniVerse.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, UniVerse will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the UniVerse to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous UniVerse home folder.

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Known Issues

1. **Using multiple screens**:  
If you move the application to a secondary screen, then switch back to using only the primary screen, the GUI may open off-screen. To resolve this, delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running it again.
2. **Help Window minimization issue**:  
If you minimize the Help Window and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the `F1` shortcut) again, the original Help Window will stay minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. To resolve this, manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Major and University field validation**:
   - **Current Behaviour**: The application allows numbers-only input for the **major** and **university** fields (e.g., `m/12345` or `u/9876`).
   - **Limitation**: There is no restriction to prevent users from entering purely numerical values or module codes as majors and universities, which can cause inaccurate data.
   - **Planned Solution**: Stricter input validation to prevent numbers-only entries for these fields in future versions.
4. **Empty address book after deleting fields in JSON data file**:
   - **Current Behaviour**: If certain fields are deleted directly in the JSON data file, the UniVerse app may start with an empty address book without displaying an error message.
   - **Limitation**: There is no error handling to detect missing fields in the JSON data file, leading to data loss.
   - **Planned Solution**: Future versions may include validation to check for required fields in the JSON file and notify users of any missing fields upon loading.
5. **Future dates allowed in the `birthday` field**:
   - **Current Behaviour**: The application allows dates in the future to be entered as a birthday when adding a new contact.
   - **Limitation**: Accepting future dates for birthdays may lead to unrealistic data entries.
   - **Planned Solution**: Implement input validation to restrict the `birthday` field to past dates only.
6. **Adding interests with multiple `in/` prefixes**:
   - **Current Behaviour**: When using the `addi` command with multiple `in/` prefixes (e.g., `addi in/1 in/2 i/interest`), only the contact specified by the last `in/` index will receive the newly added interest.
   - **Limitation**: The command does not support adding interests to multiple contacts simultaneously, which could be confusing if users attempt to use multiple `in/` prefixes.
   - **Planned Solution**: Enforce validation to allow only one `in/` prefix in the `addi` command, or consider expanding functionality to support multiple contacts.
7. **Limitations with the `Work experience` field**:
   - **Current Behaviour**:
     - The `role` field cannot contain numbers or special characters, and can only accept one word.
     - The `company` field cannot contain numbers, and can only accept one word.
     - The `year` field accepts dates in the future.
   - **Limitation**:
     - The `role` and `company` fields for the `addw` command cannot contain spaces and are limited to single words.
     - There is limited flexibility in formatting for `Work experience`, which can cause inconsistencies.
   - **Planned Solution**: Relax the input validation for the `Work experience` field to allow:
     - Spaces after commas.
     - Optional capitalization of the first word.
     - Multi-word entries for both role and company (e.g., `software engineer, Jane Street, 2024`).
8. **Interest field length limit in `addi` command**:
   - **Current Behaviour**: Users can add interests that exceed 20 characters using the `addi` command, but the UI may truncate or cut off interests that are longer, potentially causing some interests to be partially displayed or hidden.
   - **Limitation**: The application does not enforce a character limit for interests in the `addi` command, resulting in display issues for longer entries.
   - **Planned Solution**: Introduce validation to limit interests to 20 characters in the `addi` command, or  ensure that all displayed interests fit within the UI without truncation.
9. **Error Messages for `findi`, `findu`, and `findm` Commands**
   - **Current Behaviour**: The error messages for `findi`, `findu`, and `findm` display the parameter label as `KEYWORD`, which is too generic.
      - **findi**: `"Invalid command format! findi: Finds all persons whose interests contain the specified keyword (case-insensitive) and displays them as a list with index numbers. Parameters: i/KEYWORD Example: findi i/reading"`
      - **findu**: `"Invalid command format! findu: Finds all persons whose universities contain the specified keyword (case-insensitive) and displays them as a list. Parameters: u/KEYWORD Example: findu u/NUS"`
      - **findm**: `"Invalid command format! findm: Finds all persons whose major or course contains the specified keyword (case-insensitive) and displays them as a list with index numbers. Parameters: KEYWORD Example: findm m/Computer Science"`
   - **Limitation**: The use of `KEYWORD` in parameter descriptions can be unclear, as it doesn’t specify the expected input type (e.g., `INTEREST` for `findi`, `UNIVERSITY` for `findu`, etc.).
   - **Planned Solution**: Update error messages to display specific parameter names, as in the `add` command:
      - **findi**: `"Invalid command format! findi: Finds all persons whose interests contain the specified keyword (case-insensitive) and displays them as a list with index numbers. Parameters: i/INTEREST Example: findi i/reading"`
      - **findu**: `"Invalid command format! findu: Finds all persons whose universities contain the specified keyword (case-insensitive) and displays them as a list. Parameters: u/UNIVERSITY Example: findu u/NUS"`
      - **findm**: `"Invalid command format! findm: Finds all persons whose major or course contains the specified keyword (case-insensitive) and displays them as a list with index numbers. Parameters: m/MAJOR Example: findm m/Computer Science"`

   This change will ensure that error messages are more precise, helping users understand the expected input for each command.
10. **Stricter Input Validation for `find` Commands**

   - **Current Behaviour**:
     - The `findu`, `findm`, and `findw` commands currently allow multiple inputs for the same parameter (e.g., `findu u/NUS u/SMU`, `findm m/Computer m/Accounting`, `findw w/Google w/Facebook`). While these commands are accepted without any error, they yield "0 persons listed!" because the application does not currently support searches across multiple values for these fields.
  - **Limitation**:
     - Users may expect the commands to return contacts matching any of the specified values. For instance:
        - `findu u/NUS u/SMU` may be expected to return contacts from either "NUS" or "SMU".
        - `findm m/Computer Science m/Accounting` may be expected to return contacts taking double majors in "Computer Science" and "Accounting".
        - `findw w/Google w/Facebook` may be expected to return contacts who have worked at either "Google" or "Facebook".
     - This lack of functionality limits the flexibility of the search and may lead to user confusion if they try to search across multiple values without understanding the limitation.
  - **Planned Solution**:
     - **Enhance Input Validation**: Implement stricter validation to ensure that only one instance of each parameter (`u/`, `m/`, `w/`) is accepted per command. If multiple instances are provided, the application should return an error message indicating that only one value per parameter is allowed.
     - **Extend Search Functionality**:
        - **Find by Multiple Universities**: Update the `findu` command to support multiple universities as input, allowing users to retrieve contacts from any specified universities. For example, `findu u/NUS u/SMU` would return contacts from both "NUS" and "SMU". This could be useful for students looking to expand their network across different universities.
        - **Find by Multiple Majors**: Update the `findm` command to support multiple majors, enabling users to find contacts from a range of academic fields. This enhancement would be particularly valuable in cases where students pursue double majors or dual degrees, which are increasingly common in real-world university programs. For example, `findm m/Computer Science m/Accounting` would return contacts majoring in both "Computer Science" and "Accounting".
        - **Find by Multiple Work Experiences**: Update the `findw` command to support searches by multiple companies, allowing users to find contacts with experience at more than one organisation. This feature could be useful for users trying to connect with contacts who have experience in similar industries or have worked for companies of interest. For example, `findw w/Google w/Facebook` would return contacts who have worked at either "Google" or "Facebook".

   **Real-Life Use Cases**:
   - A student interested in networking with peers from both "NUS" and "SMU" could use `findu u/NUS u/SMU` to find contacts from either university. 
   - A student considering a double major in "Computer Science" and "Accounting" might use `findm m/Computer Science m/Accounting` to connect with others in both majors. 
   - A recent graduate interested in working for tech giants might use `findw w/Google w/Facebook` to reach out to contacts who have interned or worked at these companies.

## Glossary

- **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A user interface that allows interaction with the application through text-based commands, enabling quick and efficient data entry and command execution.

- **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: The visual component of the application that users interact with. It includes buttons, panels, and other visual elements to make navigation easier.

- **Keyword**: A word or phrase used to search for or filter contacts within the app (e.g., an interest or university name in search commands).

- **Index**: The numerical identifier assigned to each contact in the list, used in commands such as `delete 1` or `edit 2` to specify which contact is being referenced.

- **Tag**: A label attached to a contact for categorization and easy filtering. Tags help organize contacts based on shared attributes or groups.

- **University**: The name of the institution where a contact is studying or has studied. This field helps users find and connect with peers from specific universities.

- **Major**: The field of study that a contact is pursuing or has completed. It helps users find contacts within the same academic field.

- **Work Experience**: Information detailing a contact’s professional experience, formatted as `role,company,year` (e.g., `Intern,Google,2023`).

- **Interest**: A hobby or activity that a contact is interested in, used to connect with others who share similar interests.

- **Find Command**: A command used to filter and display contacts based on specific criteria (e.g., `findu`, `findm`, `findi`, `findw`).

- **Alphanumeric**: Refers to characters that are either letters (A-Z, a-z) or numbers (0-9). It may include symbols such as underscores (_) and hyphens (-) in certain contexts, but generally excludes special characters unless specified.

- **Case-Insensitive**: A search term or keyword that matches regardless of whether it is in uppercase or lowercase (e.g., `findu u/nus` matches both "NUS" and "nus").

- **Partial Match**: A feature in some commands where the search does not require an exact match of the keyword, but can find results that contain the keyword as part of a longer string (e.g., `findm m/Comp` could match "Computer Science" and "Computer Engineering").
