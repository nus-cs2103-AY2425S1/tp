# FindingbrUdders User Guide

Has CS become too stressful? Tired of connecting through Talent Connect, LinkedIn, or even NUSConfessIT? 
Want to form a more personal relationship full of genuine human touch? Let's make finding benefactors, dependable colleagues, and insightful mentors easier for you!

FindingbrUdders is a **desktop app designed exclusively for School of Computing (SoC) students** to manage contacts and schedule meetings, keeping track of the countless friends
you can make along the way during your university journey. As an Udder (a person in the contact book or the user), you can add new people you meet (other Udders) to the app via a simple to use
Command Line Interface (CLI). Furthermore, you can edit, update and keep track of meetings with others in an organised fashion. 
You will _**never forget**_ the meaningful connections you make or the meetings you have after using FindingbrUdders!

    You can check the version by running `java -version` in the command terminal. <br>
    **Windows**: You can access the command terminal by pressing `Win + R` and typing `cmd` in the dialog box that appears. Press `Enter` to open the command terminal. <br>
    **Mac**: You can access the command terminal by pressing `Cmd + Space` and typing `Terminal` in the search bar that appears. Press `Enter` to open the command terminal. <br>

    To run any commands, type them in the command terminal and press `Enter`.

2. If you do not have Java installed, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html). 

3. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F08-3/tp/releases/).

    The latest release can be found at the top of the page. Under the `Assets` section, download the `.jar` file by clicking on it.

## Features

<box type="info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Whitespace **within** a parameter is not allowed for any command (i.e st/21-10-2024 __ 10:00) is not allowed as it will be treated as the invalid format.

* For all commands involving tags, take note that tags can only be **one word** containing alphanumeric characters (i.e **no spaces**).

* For all commands, the command word is **_case-sensitive_**.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.<br>

* The limit of the command length is 2000 characters. Anything beyond that might cause the app to crash.

identical capitalization and spacing, while contacts with matching values in other fields are not considered duplicates.
* The name of the contact is _case-sensitive_ so `John Doe` and `JoHn DoE` are treated as 2 different contacts; Be careful in inputting names!

<box type="tip">

**Tip:** An Udder can have any number of tags (including 0) but if there are duplicate tags (i.e same tag), they will be compressed into one tag.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my Udder data to anudder (pun intended) Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer as per the Quick Start guide. Copy the `findingbrUdders.json` file from the previous computer to the new computer. Replace the empty `findingbrUdders.json` file in new computer with the `findingbrUdders.json` file from the previous computer. Your `findingbrUdders.json` file is located in the `data` folder of the directory where the `findingbrUdders.jar` file is located.

**Q**: Can I undo a command in FindingbrUdders?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, there is no undo feature available at this time. Please double-check your inputs before executing any commands, especially for irreversible actions like deleting a contact.

**Q**: Can I change the location of the saved `findingbrUdders.json` file?<br>
**A**: The location of the `findingbrUdders.json` file is automatically set to the folder where the `.jar` file is stored. If you wish to change it, you need to move the `.jar` file to the desired folder, as the data file will follow.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. <br>
Solution: delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again to prevent this problem.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. <br>
Solution: manually restore the minimized Help Window.
