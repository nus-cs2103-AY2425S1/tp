# TrueRental User Guide

TrueRental is a **desktop** application for managing your clients' details, **optimized** for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).<br>

TrueRental prioritises **productivity** and **efficiency**.

TrueRental can get your client management tasks done **much faster** than traditional GUI apps, due to minimal mouse
movements and distractions.

Our application allows you to perform multiple operations that suits your needs as a **letting agent**, such as:

1. Adding new clients
2. Updating existing clients
3. Removing outdated clients
4. Finding clients who match a criteria
5. Import and export client details

This project is built on top of [AddressBook-Level3 Project](https://se-education.org/). Special thanks and appreciation
for the team of AddressBook-Level 3.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TrueRental application.

4. Open a command terminal, navigate into the folder you put the jar file in using the command `cd`, and use the `java -jar truerental.jar` command
   to run the application.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press `Enter` to execute it. E.g. Typing `help` in the command box and
   pressing `Enter` will open the help window.<br>

6. **Simple and Quick Tutorial**:

    1. `cadd n/Steven Tan e/steventan@tutorial.com p/98765432`: Adds a client named `Steven Tan` with
       email `steventan@tutorial.com` and phone number `98765432`.

    2. `list`: Lists all clients. There should be 6 clients listed within the TrueRental application.

    3. `cdelete 3`: Deletes the 3rd client shown in the current list, named `Charlotte Oliveiro`.<br>
       Enter `y`: Yes for confirmation to the operation.

    4. `clear`: Deletes every client and their associated rental information.<br>
       Enter `y`: Yes for confirmation to the operation.

    5. `exit`: Exits the application.

## Important Notes

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about command format:**<br>

* Commands are **case-sensitive** and should always be **lowercase**.<br>
  E.g. `help`, `cadd`, `cedit`, `list`.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the **parameters** to be supplied by the user.<br>
  E.g. in `cadd n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items without brackets are **mandatory**, you must provide a value.<br>
  E.g. `n/NAME` for `cadd`, `CLIENT_INDEX` and `a/ADDRESS` for `radd`.

* Items in square brackets `[]` are **mandatory** to have **at least one of them**, you should not omit all of them in a command.<br>
  E.g `cedit` can be used as `cedit 1 n/Steven Tan e/steventan@abc.com p/98765432` or `cedit 1 n/Steven Tan p/98765432`.

* Items in curly brackets `{}` are **optional**, you may choose not to have them in your command.<br>
  E.g. `radd` can be used as `radd 1 a/140 Robinson Road, #03-05, Chow House`
  or `radd 1 a/140 Robinson Road, #03-05, Chow House m/3200 dd/10 d/0`.

* Items with `...`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  E.g. `k/KEYWORDS` for `find` can be used as `find k/Steven Tan k/98765432` (2 times), `find k/98765432` (1 time), etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  E.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* There should be minimally one whitespace between every parameter option flag<br> E.g. `n/James Tan e/jamestan@example.com`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `sort` and `clear`)
  will be ignored.<br>
  E.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Some commands will prompt for confirmation. Inputting `y` or `yes` counts as **confirmation**, and **any other input** 
  counts as **cancellation**.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Duplicate Client Detection

A client is only considered as **duplicate** **if and only if** all three parameters `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`
and `EMAIL_ADDRESS` are **exactly the same** (including case sensitivity).

This is to allow the user to have a greater flexibility of manipulating the client's information.

**For example:** All the clients stated below the initial client are **NOT CONSIDERED** as duplicates.

<box type="info" light>

An **initial client** with the name `Jason Lee`, phone number `91231231` and email address `jasonlee@example.com`

</box>

<box type="success" light>

The following are **NOT DUPLICATES** of the initial client:

1. A client with the name `Jason Lee`, phone number `99998888` and email address `jasonlee@example.com`.
2. A client with the name `Jason Lee`, phone number `91231231` and email address `NOTjasonlee@example.com`.
3. A client with the name `Jason Lee`, phone number `â€”` and email address `jasonlee@example.com`.
4. A client with the name `Jason Lee`, phone number `91231231` and email address `â€”`.
5. A client with the name `JASON LEE`, phone number `91231231` and email address `jasonlee@example.com`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** `â€”` signifies an empty parameter without any characters.

</box>

</box>

<box type="wrong" light>

The following is a **DUPLICATE** of the initial client:

1. A client with the name: `Jason Lee`, phone number: `91231231` and email address `jasonlee@example.com`.

<box type="important" seamless>

**Constraints:**

* The `CLIENT_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed client list and must be a positive integer
  starting from 1.
* The `RENTAL_INDEX` refers to the client's rental index number shown in the displayed rental information list (
  run `rview CLIENT_INDEX` to display the rental information list) and must be a positive integer starting from 1.
  * If you already know the `RENTAL_INDEX` of the rental information you want to edit, you can just use it directly in the command without needing to run `rview CLIENT_INDEX` to check for the `RENTAL_INDEX`.
* You cannot and should not edit the value of `ADDRESS` to be empty, as it is required to not be empty.
* Editing a parameter will remove its existing value and replace with the newly specified value.

</box>

  fields, if any.
  <br>E.g. `Han` will match <code><b>Han</b>s</code>
* Tags (`[t/TAG]`) will match **exactly**.
  <br>E.g. `t/Friend` will **only** match with the tag `Friend`, **not** `Friends` or `MyBestFriend`.
* Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  <br>E.g. `k/Hans k/Bo` will return <code><b>Han</b>s Gruber</code>, <code><b>Bo</b> Yang</code>`

### Editing the data file

TrueRental data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are
welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TrueRental will discard all data and start with an empty
data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TrueRental to behave in unexpected ways (E.g. if a value entered is outside
the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Export the data file in the current computer with the `export` command. Install the app in the other computer
and use the `import` command to import the data file that you previously exported.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **The commands are not case-insensitive**. The remedy is to ensure that all commands are either capitalised or not capitalised.
4. Current **error message for invalid value** of `MONTHLY_RENT` and `DEPOSIT` is not precise enough (we use the term `numbers`). Please follow [Parameter Constraints Table](#parameter-constraints-table) for valid values.
5. Current **error message for invalid value** of `CUSTOMER_LIST` is not precise enough (we only mention you should separate the names by ; if there is more than one customer). Please follow [Parameter Constraints Table](#parameter-constraints-table) for valid values.
6. If a **parameter value is too long**, it will not display fully in the application. The excess characters will be cut off and replace by `...`. You should not provide a value that is too long to avoid this issue.
7. The error message of `import` and `export` is displayed with a green color, which may be confusing for users.
8. The error message displayed when `import` or `export` fails is quite vague ("The chosen file may be corrupted").
   We will be refining this error message in the future to give more feedback about what went wrong 
   (duplicate clients, missing field, etc.)
9. The message for confirmation prompts state `y/n`, which implies you can only use `n` to cancel the command. However,
   any input other than `y`/`yes` leads to cancellation.
10. The message displayed when a command is cancelled has green color, which may be confusing for users.
11. An error occurs in the background when you first launch TrueRental, due to the absence of the `CommandHistory` storage file. The file will subsequently be created after the user enters his/her first `TrueRental's` command. This will not hinder your experience.
