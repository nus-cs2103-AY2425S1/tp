# **FAQ**

## **Q1: How can I easily find the correct Product IDs when adding orders?**
**A:** When adding orders, you can use these tips to find the correct Product IDs:

For Customer Orders:
1. First run `viewPastryCatalogue` to see all available pastries and their IDs
2. Keep the catalogue visible while typing your `addCustomerOrder` command
3. Reference the IDs from the catalogue for the `o/PASTRYID` parameter
4. Example workflow:
   ```
   > viewPastryCatalogue
   [catalogue appears showing pastries and their IDs]
   > addCustomerOrder n/John p/98765432 o/1 2 3
   ```

For Supply Orders:
1. First run `viewIngredientCatalogue` to see all ingredients and their IDs
2. Keep the catalogue visible while typing your `addSupplyOrder` command
3. Reference the IDs from the catalogue for the `o/INGREDIENTID` parameter
4. Example workflow:
   ```
   > viewIngredientCatalogue
   [catalogue appears showing ingredients and their IDs]
   > addSupplyOrder n/Tim p/81234567 o/1 2
   ```

## **Q2: How do I view all customers/suppliers easily?**
**A:** We can use the filter command to view all customers/suppliers.
   ```
   filterContact t/Customer
   ```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Q3: How do I add collection dates and large quantities to orders?**
**A:** You can include collection dates and quantities in the order's remark field:
```
addCustomerOrder n/John p/91234567 o/1 2 r/Collection: 25/12/2024 6pm, Qty: 2x 
Croissant, 3x Muffin
```

Best practices for remarks:
- Start with collection date/time
- List quantities clearly
- Add any special instructions last
- Use consistent format for dates

## **Q4: Can I add multiple products with the same ID in one order?**
**A:** Yes, you can repeat Product IDs in your order if the customer wants multiple of the same item. For example:
```
addCustomerOrder n/John p/98765432 o/1 1 1
```
This would add three units of ingredient ID 1 to the order.

## **Q5: How are orders sorted in the list?**
**A:** Orders are automatically sorted in this priority:
1. Pending orders (shown first)
- Sorted by date added (newest first)
2. Completed orders (shown after pending)
- Sorted by completion date (newest first)

This sorting helps you:
- Focus on pending orders that need attention
- Keep track of recent completions
- Maintain an organized workflow

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Q6: How do I tag contacts with multiple tags?**
**A:** You can add multiple tags to contacts in several ways:
1. When creating a new contact:
   ```
   addContact n/John p/91234567 t/VIP t/Regular
   ```
2. When editing an existing contact:
   ```
   editContact 1 t/Wholesale t/Priority
   ```

Tags are useful for:
- Marking special status (e.g., t/VIP, t/Priority)
- Noting preferences (e.g., t/NutFree, t/Halal)

## **Q7: Are the commands case-sensitive?**
**A:** Yes, commands and parameter prefixes are case-sensitive, but parameter values are not. For example:
- ‚úÖ `addContact n/John p/12345678` (correct)
- ‚ùå `AddContact n/John p/12345678` (wrong - command must be lowercase)
- ‚ùå `addcontact N/John P/12345678` (wrong - prefixes must be lowercase)
- ‚úÖ `addContact n/JOHN p/12345678` (correct - name can be any case)

## **Q8: Why is my table not aligned properly in the UI?**
**A:** The table alignment may appear off if:
1. The window is too narrow - try widening your application window
2. There are very long entries - try using shorter entries or abbreviations

To ensure optimal viewing:
- Keep the window width as wide as possible
- Use reasonable length entries

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Q9: Why are some UI elements hidden when I minimize the screen?**
**A:** BakeBuddy is optimized for a minimum window size of 800x600 pixels. When the window is smaller:
1. Some UI elements may be hidden to prevent overlap
2. Use the scroll bars to navigate hidden content
3. Resize the window larger to see all elements simultaneously

For the best experience:
- Keep the window at recommended size (1024x768 or larger)
- Use full screen mode for optimal viewing
- Avoid resizing to minimum dimensions

## **Q10: Are there limits to email and phone number length?**
**A:** There are several constraints to email and phone number.

- Phone numbers:
  - Minimum: 3 digits
  - Maximum: 15 digits
  - Must be unique in the contact list
- Email addresses:
  - Maximum: No limit. Not advisable to input long phone number as it may disrupt the UI display.
  - Must follow standard email format (xxx@xxx.xxx)
  - Special characters allowed: . _ - @


## **Q11: Can I add two contacts with the same phone number?**
**A:** No, phone number is the unique identification number in the contact book. When a different name is attached to an 
order with a phone number that is already in the address book, the person's name in the address book will be treated as 
the entity who places the order.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Q12: Can I place a customer order from a supplier or vice versa?**
**A:** Yes, you can. You can feel free to add customer orders from a supplier (or less frequently, place supply orders 
to a customer). They will be distinguished by the order type under the person's contact card. However, the additional 
information of suppliers and customers will remain the same - ingredients supplied and information respectively. For 
additional remarks, please use the remark feature.

## **Q13: What is the point of having an addCustomer and addSupplier command?**
**A:** Customers and suppliers have unique tags. We can record additional information such as dietary preference for 
customers and record the ingredients supplied for suppliers. A general contact does not have this feature.

## **Q14: Why doesn't the name I provide in addCustomerOrder/addSupplyOrder match what's displayed?**
**A:** When adding a order, the system prioritizes the contact information already in your contact list:
- If the phone number exists in your contacts:
  - The order will be linked to the existing contact name, ignoring any new name provided
  - This ensures consistency and prevents duplicate contacts with the same phone number
- If the phone number is new:
  - A new contact will be created with the provided name and phone number

For example, to handle orders being collected by someone else, use the remarks field to specify the collector:
```
addCustomerOrder n/John p/91234567 o/1 2 r/Collector: Mary (sister), 
Collection: 25/12/2024 6pm
```
This system helps maintain clean contact records while still allowing flexibility in order collection arrangements.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Q15: Why do I still see deleted pastries/ingredients in my orders?**
**A:** When a pastry or ingredient is removed from the catalogue, orders containing these items will retain their names:
- This preserves the order history and ensures you can track past transactions
- The system maintains a record of what was actually ordered, even if the item is no longer available
- While you cannot add new orders with deleted items, existing orders remain unchanged for accounting purposes

For example, if you delete "Croissant" from your pastry catalogue:
- All past customer orders for croissants will still show "Croissant" in their order details
- New orders cannot include croissants until the item is added back to the catalogue
- This helps maintain accurate business records while preventing new orders of discontinued items
