## Quick start

1. Ensure that you have **Java 17 or above** installed on your computer:
    * If you are unsure, you can check if Java is installed by running `java --version`. For more instruction, you can refer to this link [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html).
    * If Java is not installed, you can refer to this guide on how to install [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html).
      * You can also download Java directly from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).


2. Download the latest release version of AgentConnect. The application is a `.jar` file:
    * Get the latest version of AgentConnect from [this link](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/releases). Look for a file named `AgentConnect.jar`.
  

3. Place the File:
   * Move the `AgentConnect.jar` file to a home folder where you want to store the application and its data.
   * Note that the data folder created by the `.jar` file which stores the client data will be stored in the same home folder


4. Run the Application:
    - **Option 1: Double-Click:**
      Simply double-click the `AgentConnect.jar` file to start the application. If this method does not work, try Option 2 below.
    - **Option 2: Use Command Prompt:**
      Open the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux), navigate to the folder containing the `AgentConnect.jar` file, and type:
      ```
      java -jar AgentConnect.jar
      ```
      For example, if you stored the `AgentConnect.jar` file in the directory `C:/Users/Desktop/Applications`, then run the following command:
      ```
      cd C:/Users/Desktop/Applications
      java -jar AgentConnect.jar
      ```

## Getting Started

### Understanding Command Format

Users engage with the AgentConnect application by inputting a series of commands. These commands enable a variety of actions, such as adding, updating, listing, and managing clients and policies, as well as retrieving client information like appointments and birthdays. This section will introduce some pointers to take note of when running commands.

* Angle brackets <> are placeholders for information you need to provide.
  Example: In `add n/<NAME>`, replace `NAME` with the client's name.  
   

* Square brackets [ ] indicate optional items.
  Example: `n/<NAME> [t/TAG]` means the `t/TAG` part is optional.


* Ellipsis ... means you can include the item multiple times or not at all. Example: `[t/TAG]...` allows for multiple tags or none.


* The parameters for the commands does not matter and you can enter the parameters in any order.
  Example: `n/John p/123` is the same as `p/123 n/John`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* AgentConnect automatically checks and corrects dates to ensure that they are valid, helping to prevent scheduling errors.
  * If a date is entered with an invalid day (eg. `2028-02-30`), Agent Connect will adjust it to the nearest valid date within the month, such as `2028-02-29`. This intelligent replacement only applies to dates up to the 31st day of any month.
  * This applies to only adding, assigning and editing function only.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Before every prefix, ensure that there is a whitespace at the front. Else, the command might not work. (E.g. `add n/John p/889955` will work but `add n/Johnp/889955` will not work.)

* For commands that requires datetime input, ensure that there is a whitespace between the date and the time (E.g. `2024-10-10 13:00`)

### Viewing Help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

### Saving the data

AgentConnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.


### Exiting the program : `exit`

### Adding a client : `add`

Adds a client to the address book.

Format: 
`add n/<NAME> p/<PHONE NUMBER> e/<EMAIL ADDRESS> addr/<HOME ADDRESS> b/<BIRTHDAY> appt/<APPOINTMENT TIME>`

- **Parameters**:
    * Name can only contain alphanumeric and spaces. 
    * Birthday should be in `yyyy-mm-dd` and only can be a date before today's date.
    * Appointment should be in `yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm` and accept only future dates.
    * Phone number can only be 3 to 8 digits long.
    * Client's name can contain whitespaces. `John Doe` and `John    Doe` will be considered as 2 different client.
    * Clients with the same name and address are considered as duplicates. 
    * Do note that the names are case-sensitive. 
    * The system standardises addresses by removing special characters such as commas, spaces, and hyphens and making
      all characters lowercase. This means that "311, Clementi Ave 5, unit 02-2" and
      "311 Clementi ave 5 unit 022" (without commas) will be treated as the same client address.

Example:
* The command below adds a new client to the client list with the following information:
    * Client name: Betsy Crowe
    * Client number: 1234567
    * Client email: betsycrowe@example.com
    * Home address: Newgate Prison
    * Client birthday: 2001-10-10

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">ðŸ’¡**Tip:**
Always verify the clientâ€™s index number or exact name before executing the delete command to prevent accidental removals.
Best Practice: Use the list or find command to confirm the exact client you intend to delete.
</div>

Examples:
* `find Denon` followed by `delete 3` deletes the 3rd client in the results of the `find` command.
  ![result for 'delete david li'](images/deleteUI.png)

* Delete the client named `Betsy Crowe` from the list of the address book.
  ```
  delete Betsy Crowe
  ```

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**

  * At least one of the optional fields must be provided.

  * When editing policy, all fields of policy must be included

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">ðŸ’¡ **Tip:**
Although tags are optional, using them can be useful if you want to store additional information about the client.
For example, if a client is a VIP, you can include it in the client's information using the edit command.
</div>

Examples:
- *Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st client to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.*:

you can type "healthadvantagepolicy3" instead. The search result will be the same.
</div>

Example:
  - **Search by Specific Policy**: Finds all clients who own the policy named "PolicyOne".
    ```
    search p/ PolicyOne
    ```

## Policy Management

The policy management section contain commands that allows you to manage policy-related information, such as assigning policy, deleting policy and updating policy payment.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> **Note:**

At times, after assigning a policy to a client or deleting a policy, the user interface may not immediately display the updates. You can try double-clicking on another client's profile card and then returning to the target profile card to see the changes reflected. Alternatively, you can use the `find` or `search` commands to trigger a UI refresh.

## Advanced Features

| **Action**                                        | **Command Format** | **Command Example** |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| [Undo the Last Command](#undo-a-command--undo)    | `undo`             | `undo`              |
| [Redo the Last Undo Work](#redo-a-command--redo)  | `redo`             | `redo`              |
| [Clear All Entries](#clearing-all-entries--clear) | `clear`            | `clear`             |

### Undo a command : `undo`
Undo the last command. This command works for add, edit, delete client and clear commands.


Format: `undo` 

* Undo the last command to restore the address book to the state before the last command.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> **Note:**
The `undo` command does not work for assign and deletion of policies, so any commands before the assign/delete of policies
will be undone. For example, if I add a client, assign a policy to that client, then enter undo, it will undo the add command.
</div>

Examples:
* `delete 1` followed by `undo` will restore back the deleted client at index 1.
* `clear` followed by `undo` will restore back all the deleted clients.
![result for 'undo'](images/undoUI.png)


---
### Redo a command : `redo`
Redo the last undo. Works for add, edit, delete client and clear commands.

Format: `redo`

* Redo the last undo command to restore the address book to the state before the undo command.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> **Note:**
The `redo` command does not work for assign and deletion of policies.
</div>

Examples:
* `delete 1` followed by `undo` followed by `redo` will delete the client at index 1 again.
* `clear` followed by `undo` followed by `redo` will clear all the entries again.
![redo a deletion](images/redoUI.png)

---

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If you accidentally used the `clear` command and want to revert back, do not run any other commands.
Run `undo` immediately to restore the data.

Upon entering the clear command, a pop up for confirmation will appear. Do not close or minimize the
CLI interface when the pop up is displayed. This will cause the program to crash.
</div>

---

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q:** How do I check if I have Java installed?

**A:** Open the Command Prompt or Terminal and type `java -version`. If Java is installed, it will show the version number. For more information, you can refer [here](#quick-start).

---

**Q:** Can I run AgentConnect on a Mac or Linux computer?

**A:** Yes! As long as you have Java 17 or above installed, AgentConnect will work on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

---

**Q:** How do I back up my data?

**A:** Your data is stored in the `addressbook.json` file in the `data` folder. Copy this file to a safe location to back up your data.

---

**Q:** What happens if I enter the wrong command?

**A:** AgentConnect will show an error message explaining what went wrong. You can then try the command again.

---

**Q:** Can I assign multiple policies to one client?

**A:** Yes, you can assign multiple policies by using the `assign` command multiple times for the same client.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issues

1. **Multiple Screens**: If you use multiple monitors and move AgentConnect to a secondary screen, it may open off-screen if that monitor is disconnected.  
   **Solution**: Delete the `preferences.json` file in the application folder before restarting AgentConnect.

2. **Help Window Minimization**: If you minimize the Help window and try to open another help window (using `help` command, F1 or clicking the help option in the user interface), the original help window will still be minimized. There will be no new help window pop up.  
   **Solution**: Restore the minimized Help window manually.
