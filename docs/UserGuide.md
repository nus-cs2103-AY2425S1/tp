## **Tutorial for Beginners**

If you are new to BridalBuddy, this section will walk you through all the most basic features of BridalBuddy and will make sure you know everything you need to get started.
For this tutorial section, you are highly encouraged to use exactly the sample commands provided for each tutorial, and only start trying out the commands on your own after going through the [Features](#features) section.


### Tutorial Contents
1. [**Starting a fresh template**](#starting-a-fresh-template)
2. [**Adding guests**](#adding-guests)
3. [**Adding vendors**](#adding-vendors)
4. [**Deleting persons**](#deleting-persons)
5. [**Exiting the program**](#exiting-the-program)


**Let us explore the most basic features of BridalBuddy's from the perspective of a wedding planner.**
When you open up the application for the first time, you will see the interface below, with some sample guest and vendors on the guest list and the vendor list respectively.

![Ui](images/firstUseUi.png)

At the top of the screen, there is a text box we will refer to as the *Command Line*. This is where you type in your commands to BridalBuddy.

To confirm your instructions, simply press the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard.

Below the *Command Line* is the *Outcome Box*, which will tell you the outcome of the commands you have entered, as well as other relevant information related to that command.

Finally, below the *Outcome Box* is the *Display Panel*, which will contain the guest list and the vendor list for the wedding that you are planning.

> :bulb: After entering the commands, if the cursor disappears from the *Command Line*, you can always press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key on your keyboard a few times to bring the cursor back to the *Command Line* and continue typing instead of having to click on the *Command Line* with the mouse.

[_Back to Top_](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### **Starting a fresh template**

In order to get ready to use BridalBuddy, let's first remove the existing sample guests and vendors on our guest list and vendor list.
All we have to do is to enter the command `clear` in the Command Line, and both the guest list and the vendor list will be emptied and ready for you to plan a new wedding.
> :bulb: Remember to hit the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key on your keyboard to confirm an instruction/command to BridalBuddy.

Once successful, you should see the following on your screen:

![clear command](images/clearCommand.png)

[_Back to Top_](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### **Adding guests**

Now let's say your customer, the groom, sends you the first guest he wishes to invite, and we want to add him to the guest list of the wedding.
Let us familiarise ourselves with the `add_guest` command, which you will need in order to add guests to the guest list.

Let's try entering the following command in the Command Line: `add_guest n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25`.

This means you are adding a new guest, with the name `John Doe`, phone number `98765432`, email `johnd@example.com` and address `311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25` to the guest list.

Once successful, you should see the following on your screen:

![add guest_command](images/addGuestCommandSample.png)

For more details on the `add_guest` command, such as the additional optional fields you can classify a guest with, we encourage you to refer to [**Adding a new guest to the guest list**](#adding-a-guest-add-guest)

[_Back to Top_](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### **Adding vendors**

Let us now add a vendor to the list of vendors you are intending to collaborate with, and familiarise ourselves with the `add_vendor` command, which you will need in order to add vendors to the vendor list.

Let's try entering the following command in the Command Line: `add_vendor n/Jane Tan p/91234567 e/janet@example.com a/743, Jurong Mall, #05-245 c/Jane's Florist`.

This means you are adding a new vendor, with the name `Jane Tan`, phone number `91234567`, email `janet@example.com`, address `743, Jurong Mall, #05-245` and company name `Jane's Florist` to the vendor list.

Once successful, you should see the following on your screen:

![add vendor_command](images/addVendorCommandSample.png)

For more details on the `add_vendor` command, such as the additional optional fields you can classify a vendor with, we encourage you to refer to [**Adding a new vendor to the vendor list**](#adding-a-vendor-add-vendor)

[_Back to Top_](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### **Deleting persons**

Suppose the bride tells us that she has a preferred florist in mind, and so you need to delete the florist you previously added to the vendor list.

Let's try entering the following command in the Command Line: `delete_vendor 1`.

This means you are deleting the first person that is currently being listed on your vendor list, which is `Jane Tan`.

Once successful, you should see the following on your screen:

![delete vendor_command](images/deleteVendorCommandSample.png)

Deleting a guest works in a similar way but using the `delete_guest` command instead.
For more details on the `delete_guest` and `delete_vendor` commands, we encourage you to refer to [**Deleting a guest from the guest list**](#deleting-a-guest-delete-guest) and [**Deleting a vendor from the vendor list**](#deleting-a-vendor-delete-vendor) respectively.

[_Back to Top_](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

### **Exiting the program**

It's been a long day at work. Now let's take a break and exit the application. All you have to do is simply enter the command `exit` in the Command Line, and the program will exit automatically in a few seconds!

* :bulb: Not to worry, your progress will be auto-saved and all your work will be reflected correctly the next time you open the app.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Features**

<box type="info" seamless>

**:bulb: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* For all commands that take in any [prefix(es)](#glossary), the prefix(es) are case-sensitive (i.e. only small letters allowed, use of capital letters will result in an `Invalid prefix detected` error.)

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, BridalBuddy will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause BridalBuddy to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file **only if** you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## **FAQ**

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous BridalBuddy home folder. This file will be known as `[JAR file location]/data/bridalbuddy.json`.

## **Known issues**

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the application will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. To avoid performance degradation, for now it is highly recommended that at most 300 `Guest`s and at most 300 `Vendor`s are tracked in the guest list and vendor list respectively at any point of time.

3. When inputting the `INDEX` for commands which require an `INDEX`, if the `INDEX` is larger than the 2147483647, an `Invalid command format` error message will be displayed instead of an error message specifying that the `Guest`/`Vendor` `INDEX` provided exceeds the number of guests/vendors (if applicable).

4. Avoid parsing slashes `/` in addresses or company names, such as in `W/T Building`, as they are misinterpreted as new prefixes.
