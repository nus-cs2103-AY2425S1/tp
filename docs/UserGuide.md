## Quick Start

In this section, let's learn how to set up MediBase3 on your computer.

### Installing MediBase3

#### Step 1: Check if you have Java 17 installed on your system.

Before running MediBase3, ensure that **Java 17** is installed on your system.

Open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS/Ubuntu/Debian) and type:
> ```
> java -version
> ```  

If you are using Windows, you should see something like:

{: .alert .alert-secondary}
>![javaVersionWindows.jpeg](images/javaVersionWindows.jpeg)
>  
>**Java Version in Windows**

This means that your machine is running Java version 17.0.12, which means that Java 17 is installed.

if you are using macOS, Ubuntu or Debian, you should see something like this:

{: .alert .alert-secondary}
>![javaVersionMacOS.png](images/javaVersionMacOS.png)
>  
>**Java Version in Mac**

This means that your machine is running Java version 17.0.11, which means that Java 17 is installed.


If your machine is **not running Java 17**, you may refer to the [FAQ section](#faq) for instructions on installing Java 17. 


#### Step 2: Download the MediBase3 JAR File

1. Go to [this link](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/releases/tag/v1.6) and scroll down all the way to 'Assets'.  You should see something like this:

   {: .alert .alert-secondary}
   >![githubAssets.png](images/githubAssets.png)
   >
   >**Asset Files in GitHub**

1. Click on `medibase3.jar` to download the latest MediBase3 JAR File.
2. Save the file to a location of your choice (e.g., `Downloads` folder).

### Launching MediBase3

1. Open **Command Prompt** (Windows) or **Terminal** (macOS/Ubuntu/Debian).
2. Navigate to the directory where the `.jar` file is located. For example:
> ```
> cd Downloads
> ```
3. Run the application by typing:
> ```
> java -jar medibase3.jar
> ```

You should be greeted by the GUI, which you will see in the next section.

The example below demonstrates this structure:

{: .alert .alert-secondary}
>![CommandAnatomy](diagrams/CommandAnatomy.svg)
>  
>**Anatomy of the Command Structure**

This example shows how a typical command might look in MediBase3, with three main components:

| **Component** | **Description**                                                              |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Command**   | The action you want to perform (e.g., `add`, `edit`)                         |
| **Prefix**    | Identifies the data being entered (e.g., `n/` for name)                      |
| **Parameter** | The value associated with the prefix (e.g., `John Doe`)                      |
| **Preamble**  | The value immediately after the command with no prefixes (e.g., `S1234567A`) |

{: .alert .alert-info}
> :information_source: **Note:**

> **:information_source: Notes about the command format:**
> 
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.
> e.g. in `add n/NAME i/NRIC g/GENDER d/DOB p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `n/John Doe`.
>
> * Items in square brackets are optional.
>  e.g `edit NRIC [n/NAME] [i/NRIC] [d/DOB] [g/GENDER] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS]` can be used as `edit S1234567A n/John Lim g/M` or as `edit S1234567A g/M`.
>
> * Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times.
>  e.g. `c/CONDITION…` can be used as, `c/Knee Pain`, `c/Flu c/Fever` etc.
>
> * Parameters that have a prefix can be in any order.
> e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.
>
> * Parameters that have no prefix must follow the specified order in the command format.
> e.g. if the command specifies `NRIC n/NAME p/PHONE`, `NRIC` must take precedence over `n/NAME` and `p/PHONE`.
> 
> * Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.
> e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
>
> * The command name and prefixes are case-insensitive.
> e.g. `add` is the same as `ADD`, `c/` is the same as `C/`.
>
> * If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Managing Patient

#### Adding a patient: `add`

Adds a patient and his/her relevant details to MediBase3.

**Format**: `add n/NAME i/NRIC d/DOB g/GENDER p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS`

{: .alert .alert-info}
> :information_source: **Notes:**
> 
> * All fields are compulsory and must be non-empty.
> * If the `NRIC` provided already exists in MediBase3, an error message will be displayed, and the patient will not be added.
> * The new patient will be added to the end of the Patient List Panel.
> * Refer to the [Parameter Details](#parameter-details) section for more information on the purpose and constraints of each parameter.

**Examples**:
* `add n/John Doe i/S1234567A d/2002-12-12 g/M p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/Orchard Road, Block 124, #02-01` adds a patient named `John Doe` with the respective NRIC, gender, date of birth, phone number, email and address provided into MediBase3.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

{: .alert .alert-success}
> :bulb: **Tips:**
> 
> * Remember that `NRIC` and `GENDER` are case-insensitive.
>   -  e.g. `i/s1234567a` and `i/S1234567A` are both equivalent.
> * Made a mistake or a typo? You can use the [`edit` command](#editing-a-patient--edit) to update the patient's details.

#### Deleting a patient : `delete`

Deletes a patient and his/her details from MediBase3.

**Format**: `delete NRIC`

{: .alert .alert-info}
> :information_source: **Notes:**
> 
> * Deletes the patient with the specified `NRIC` from MediBase3.
> * The `NRIC` provided must be the full NRIC of the patient to be deleted.
>   - e.g. `S1234567A` (not partial, like `S123`).
> * Refer to [Parameter Details](#parameter-details) for NRIC constraints.

**Example**:
* `delete S1234567A` deletes the patient with the NRIC `S1234567A`.

{: .alert .alert-warning}
> :exclamation: **Caution:**
> 
> * Patient information **cannot be recovered** once deleted. Double-check the `NRIC` before deletion.
> * Deleting a patient also removes all associated appointments from the Appointment List Panel.

#### Editing a patient : `edit`

Edits an existing patient details in MediBase3.

**Format**: `edit NRIC [n/NAME] [i/NRIC] [g/GENDER] [d/DOB] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS]`

{: .alert .alert-info}
> :information_source: **Notes:**
> 
> * Edits the patient with the specified `NRIC` in MediBase3.
> * The NRIC provided must be the full NRIC of the patient to be edited. 
>   - e.g. `S1234567A` (not partial, like `S123`).
> * **At least one** of the optional fields must be provided. 
>   - e.g. `edit S1234567A` is invalid.
> * Existing values will be updated to the given input values.
> * Refer to [Parameter Details](#parameter-details) for constraints on each parameter.

**Example**:
*  `edit S1234567A p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` will edit the phone number and email address of the patient with the NRIC`S1234567A`
to `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

{: .alert .alert-success}
> :bulb: **Tip:**
> 
> Editing the patient's `NAME` or `NRIC` will also update his/her associated appointments in the Appointment List Panel to reflect the change.

### Managing Appointments

#### Adding an Appointment : `addAppt`

Schedules an appointment for a patient in MediBase3.

**Format**: `addAppt APPOINTMENT_NAME i/NRIC @d/APPOINTMENT_DATE @t/APPOINTMENT_TIME`

{: .alert .alert-info}
> :information_source: **Notes:**
>
> * Adds an appointment with the specified `APPOINTMENT_NAME`, `APPOINTMENT_DATE`, and `APPOINTMENT_TIME` for the patient identified by `NRIC`.
> * Refer to [Parameter Details](#parameter-details) for constraints on each parameter.


{: .alert .alert-warning}
> :exclamation: **Caution:**
>
> * For each patient, appointment times cannot overlap.
> * Earliest valid appointment time is `0000`, and latest is `2359`.
> * Appointments cannot span across date boundaries

**Example**:
* `addAppt Dental i/S1234567A @d/2024-10-27 @t/1100-1200` schedules a `Dental` appointment for the patient with `NRIC` `S1234567A` on `2024-10-27`, from `1100` to `1200`.

{: .alert .alert-secondary}
> ![result for addAppt command example](images/addApptCommand.png)
>   
> **Success message, with the "Dental" appointment in the details of patient "Alex Yeoh (S1234567A)" in the patient list panel, as well as in the appointment list panel as the second entry.**

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

{: .alert .alert-success}
> :bulb: **Tips:**
>
> * Adding a new appointment will update the Appointment List Panel on the right with the new appointment details.
> * Appointment names need not be unique.
> * Different patients may have overlapping appointment timings, as long as those appointments are not from the same patient.
> * For appointments that span across date boundaries, add two appointments:
>   * End the first appointment at `2359` (e.g., `addAppt Transfusion i/S1234567A @d/2024-10-23 @t/2200-2359`).
>   * Start the next appointment at `0000` on the following date (e.g., `addAppt Transfusion i/S1234567A @d/2024-10-24 @t/0000-0100`).
> * Appointment end times are **exclusive**. For example:
>   * If _Appointment A_ is scheduled from `1200` to `1300`, _Appointment B_ can start at `1300`.
>   * _Appointment B_ cannot start between `1200` and `1259`, nor end between `1201` and `1300`.

#### Deleting an Appointment : `delAppt`

Deletes a scheduled appointment from MediBase3.

**Format**: `delAppt i/NRIC @d/APPOINTMENT_DATE @t/APPOINTMENT_TIME`

{: .alert .alert-info}
> :information_source: **Notes:**
>
> * Only `NRIC`, `APPOINTMENT_DATE`, and `APPOINTMENT_TIME` are required; `APPOINTMENT_NAME` is not needed.
> * Refer to [Parameter Details](#parameter-details) for constraints on each parameter.

**Example**:
* `delAppt i/S1234567A @d/2024-10-27 @t/1100-1200` deletes an appointment on `2024-10-27` from `1100` to `1200` for the patient with `NRIC` `S1234567A`.

### Managing Medical Conditions

#### Adding Medical Conditions : `addMedCon`

Adds one or more medical conditions to an existing patient in MediBase3.

**Format**: `addMedCon i/NRIC c/CONDITION...`

{: .alert .alert-info}
> :information_source: **Notes:**
>
> * Adds the specified `CONDITION` to the patient identified by `NRIC` in MediBase3.
> * **At least one** `CONDITION` must be provided. 
>   - e.g. `addMedCon i/S1234567A` is invalid.
> * Each medical condition can only be added once per patient.
> * If both unique and duplicate conditions are entered in a single command, an error will be returned, and none of the conditions will be added.
> * Refer to [Parameter Details](#parameter-details) for constraints on each parameter.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Example**:
* `addMedCon i/S1234567A c/High Blood Pressure` adds the condition `High Blood Pressure` to the patient with `NRIC` `S1234567A`.


{: .alert .alert-secondary}
>![result for addMedCon command example](images/addMedConCommand.png)
>  
> **Success message, with the "HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE" condition in the details of patient "Alex Yeoh (S1234567A)" in the patient list panel**

{: .alert .alert-success}
> :bulb: **Tips:**

 - **A**: We do not support non-English inputs, but we are working on it!


## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **When entering a patient's date of birth or an appointment date**, the application currently accepts the year `0000` as a valid year. While it might be valid in some contexts such as the [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), it is not a valid year in the [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) which is the calendar system the typical user might expect.
