### 2. Download LegacyLink

1. Get the latest version (.jar file) from our [releases page](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/releases).
2. Specifically, look for a file named ``legacylink.jar`` and click on it to download.
3. Save it in a folder where you want to store your LegacyLink data.
   * Ideally, this should be new folder specifically for LegacyLink.

### 3. Launch the Application
1. Get your folder path:
    * Open the file management application (i.e. file explorer for Windows, Finder for MacOS).
    * Navigate to the folder containing the ``jar`` file.
    * Copy the path from the address bar.
2. Open your command prompt/terminal (see instructions above).
3. Navigate to your LegacyLink folder:
    * Type `cd` followed by a space
    * **Windows**: Type your folder path (e.g., `cd C:\Users\YourName\LegacyLink`)
    * **Mac/Linux**: Type your folder path (e.g., `cd /Users/YourName/LegacyLink`)
    * *Pro tip: You can alternatively drag and drop your folder into the terminal after typing ``cd `` (with a space) to automatically fill in the path!*
4. Run LegacyLink by typing: `java -jar legacylink.jar`
5. Pressing enter will open up the LegacyLink window as shown below!

> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are values you provide
> * Parameters can be in any order
    >   * For example, if the command specifies `-n NAME -p PHONE_NUMBER`, `-p PHONE_NUMBER -n NAME` is also acceptable.
> * Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
> * If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, LegacyLink will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the LegacyLink to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

**Rules to Remember:**


| Field       | Requirements                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name        | ‚Ä¢ Letters, numbers, and spaces only<br>‚Ä¢ Cannot be blank                                                                                               |
| Phone       | ‚Ä¢ Minimally 3 digits                                                                                                                                   |
| Email       | ‚Ä¢ Must be valid email format (example@domain.com)                                                                                                      |
| Relationship| ‚Ä¢ Letters only<br>‚Ä¢ Cannot be blank<br>‚Ä¢ Note: Please enter a meaningful relationship that best describes the connection (e.g., "Friend," "Colleague," "Sibling"). |


**Note:** Names which are very long may not be fully displayed in the detailed person view, as displaying it would
compromise the aesthetic of the User Interface and overall user experience.<br/> The person can still be identified through
other information such as their phone number, email, and relationship. Additionally, <u>relationship tags are **case-sensitive**</u>.

</box>

Valid Example:
```
add -n Betsy Crowe -rs Mother -e betsycrowe@example.com -p 98262123
```
* This command adds a person named Betsy Crowe with the phone number 98262123, email betsycrowe@example.com, and the relationship Mother to the address book.
![AddCommandExample1.png](images/AddCommandExample1.png)

Invalid Example (Invalid Phone Number):
```
add -n Betsy Crowe -rs Mother -e betsycrowe@example.com -p 12
```
* This command will result in the following error message since the phone number must be at least 3 digits long.
![AddCommandInvalidExample1.png](images/AddCommandInvalidExample1.png)

Invalid Example (Duplicate Persons):
* Assuming the contact `add -n Betsy Crowe -rs Mother -e betsycrowe@example.com -p 98262123` already exists.
* Typing the following command `add -n Betsy Crowe -rs Mother -e betsycrowe@example.com -p 98262123` will result in a duplicate entry and the person will not be added.
* The following error message will be shown:
![AddCommandDuplicate.png](images/AddCommandDuplicate.png)

  

### Edit a Contact üìù

**Format:**
```
edit INDEX [-n NAME] [-p PHONE] [-e EMAIL] [-rs RELATIONSHIP]
```
* Edits an existing person in the address book.


<box type="tip" seamless>

* If you want to use special characters such as `d/o` or `s/o` in `name`, please omit the `/` and enter `so` and `do` instead.
  
</box>


Valid Example (One field edited):
* `edit 2 -n Betsy Crower` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower`.
* Note: this assumes that the address book contains at least 1 person.

![EditPersonExample2.png](images/EditPersonExample2.png)

Invalid Example:
* `edit 1` 
* This command will result in the following error message since at least one of the optional fields must be provided.
![EditPersonInvalid1.png](images/EditPersonInvalid1.png)

## Organizing Events

### View All Events üìÖ

**Format:**
```
list -e
```
* Shows a list of all events in the event book.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Preceding, trailing and intermediate whitespaces will still result in a successful command.
</box>

![ListEventCommand.png](images/ListEventCommand.png)

### Create New Event üéâ

**Format:**
```
event -n EVENT_NAME -sd EVENT_START_DATE -ed EVENT_END_DATE -l LOCATION [-a ATTENDEES]
```
* Adds an event to the event book.
* Dates are in (yyyy-mm-dd) format.



<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** 
* All parameters `EVENT_NAME`, `EVENT_START_DATE`, `EVENT_END_DATE`, `LOCATION` must be present but `ATTENDEES` is optional.
* The optional field `-a` can only be specified at most once.
* Indexes supplied to the `ATTENDEES` parameter must be based on existing contacts indexing in the Address Book.
Note that the indexes are separated by **spaces**.
* **Note**: It is an intended feature that you can add events with dates that have already passed. This is so that you can keep track of and archive past events.  
</box>

Valid Example:
* `event -n Get Together Party -sd 2023-10-25 -ed 2023-10-27 -l MBS`. <br> 
Adds a "Get together party" event to the event book.
![EventCommandExample1.png](images/EventCommandExample1.png)

* `event -n Birthday Party -sd 2023-10-15 -ed 2023-10-15 -l Home -a 1 2 3`. <br> 
Creates the birthday party event and adds the first 3 people in the contacts book to the event.
![EventCommandExample2.png](images/EventCommandExample2.png)

Invalid Example:
* `event -n Birthday Party -sd 2023-10-15 -ed 2023-10-15 -l Home -a 1, 2, 3`
* This command will result in the following error message since the list of indexes must be separated by whitespaces, not anything else like commas.
![EventCommandInvalid1.png](images/EventCommandInvalid1.png)

Invalid Example:
* `event -n New Year's Party -sd 2025-01-01 -ed 2025-01-02 -l Times Square -a 1 2 -a 4 5`
* This command will result in the following error message since the optional field `-a` is specified more than once.
![EventCommandInvalid2.png](images/EventCommandInvalid2.png)

### Update Event Details ‚úèÔ∏è

**Format:** 
```
update -i INDEX [-n NEW_NAME] [-sd NEW_START_DATE] [-ed NEW_END_DATE] [-l NEW_LOCATION] [-a NEW_ATTENDEES_INDICES] [-r REMOVED_ATTENDEES_INDICES]
```

* Updates the details of an existing event in the address book.
**Note:** Dates are in (yyyy-mm-dd) format.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** 
* The initial `INDEX` parameter is required, while the rest of the parameters are optional. The `-r` flag allows you to
remove attendees from an event, and can be used together with the `-a` flag. If you add and remove the same index, the result
will be adding the person first, then removing them, i.e. they will not be present in the attendee list after the command executes.
* Indexes supplied to the `NEW_ATTENDEES_INDICIES`  and `REMOVED_ATTENDEES INDICES` parameters must be based on existing contacts indexing in the Address Book.
* Note that the indexes are separated by **spaces**.
* Each of the optional fields can only be specified at most once. <br>
e.g. `update -i 1 -n Birthday Party -n Dinner Party -a 1 -a 2` is an invalid command.
* If you leave any trailing options but pass no arguments into them, they will be treated as part of the argument for the previous option, which is likely not what you intended to do so.<br/>
E.g. `update -i 1 -n Billy's School Musical -a 1 2 -l` is an invalid command, as the trailing `-l` (location) flag is treated as an index, since no location string was passed as an argument into it.
</box>

Valid Example (One field updated):
* `update -i 1 -l NUS UTown` only updates the location of the first event to `NUS UTown`.
![UpdateEventExample1](images/UpdateEventExample1.png)

Valid Example (Multiple field updated):
* `update -i 3 -n New Year's Party -sd 2025-01-01 -ed 2025-01-02 -l Marine Parade Road #12-34 -r 3 6` updates the 3rd event, reflecting all the provided details.
![UpdateEventExample2.png](images/UpdateEventExample2.png)

Invalid Example:
* `update -i 3 -n New Year's Party -n Christmas Celebration -a 1 2 -a 4 5`
* This command will result in the following error message since the optional fields `-n` and `-a` are specified more than once.

![UpdateEventInvalid2.png](images/UpdateEventInvalid2.png)

### Cancelling Events ‚ùå
**Format:**
```
cancel INDEX
```
* Deletes the event at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed event list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶‚Äã

<box type="warning" seamless>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This action cannot be undone, no confirmation message is displayed! You will have to use `event` command to add the event again.

</box>

Valid Example:
* `list -e` followed by `cancel 1` deletes the 1st event in the address book.
![CancelEventExample1.png](images/CancelEventExample1.png)



### Clearing All Events üóëÔ∏è

**Format:**
```
clear -e`
```
* Clears all events from the event book.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** No confirmation message is displayed. This action is irreversible, you will have to use `event` command to add all the events again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous LegacyLink home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **When creating 2 or more events that have the same name, start date, end date, and location**, it is possible for these events to have attendees which are subsets for each other, but not equal to each other. The remedy is to implement a more sophisticated duplicate event detection system to enhance user experience in the future.
4. **Imprecise error message for invalid index in `edit` command**. Currently, the error message for invalid index such as `-1` (negative numbers), `0` and integer overflow is an invalid command instead of an index out of bounds. This is a known issue and will be addressed in an upcoming update to ensure that users receive more accurate and specific error messages when encountering invalid index values.
5. **Truncation of text in the GUI**. fields with lengthy text, such as long names and address, can sometimes be truncated in the GUI. To avoid this, you can adjust the size of the window by dragging the sides to enlarge the window.
6. **Delay between updating of UI and updating of contact information**. You may notice that the UI is not immediately updated upon executing commands such as `edit` or `delete`. You may have to refresh the UI by clicking on the person/event card again to see the updated person/event information.
