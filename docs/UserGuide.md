# TAchy User Guide

TAchy is a **desktop app for managing students, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAchy can get your student
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `TAchy.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TAchy.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar TAchy.jar` command to
   run the application.
<br> By default, it should be saved in your Downloads folder. <br>
   - For Windows users: Type `cd Downloads`, and press `Enter`.
   - For MacOS and Linux users: Type `cd ~/Downloads`, and press `Enter`.
<br> However, if you have saved your file in another location, navigate to that location. <br>
   - For Windows users: Replace `{FILE_PATH}` with the location where the file is stored, type `cd {FILE_PATH}`, and press `Enter`.
   - For MacOS and Linux users: Replace `{FILE_PATH}` with the location where the file is stored, type `cd ~/{FILE_PATH}`, and press `Enter`.

5. Type the command `java -jar TAchy.jar` into the terminal to run the application.
<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all students.

   * `add_student n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com ` : Adds a student named
     `John Doe` to the app.

   * `view_student 2` : Displays the details of the 2nd student shown in the current list.

   * `delete_student 3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

   * `add_assignment si/1 an/Assignment 1 ms/100` : Adds Assignment 1 to the 1st student in the current list with max score 100.

   * `grade si/1 ai/1 s/100` : Edits the score of the 1st assignment belonging to the 1st student in the current list to be 100.

   * `clear` : Deletes all students.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

| Term           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CLI**        | A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with programs, in this case TAchy, by typing commands.                                                                                                             |
| **GUI**        | A graphical user interface (GUI) is a visual interface where users interact with programs using graphical elements like icons, buttons, and menus.                                                                                                        |
| **Assignment** | An assignment in TAchy refers to a task or piece of work assigned by the tutor (the user) to students.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Index**      | The index of a student represents their position in the currently displayed list, starting from 1 for the first student at the top.                                                                                                                       |
| **Score**      | The score represents the grade a student receives for a specific assignment.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Remark**     | A remark allows the tutor to record important notes or comments about a student for reference.                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Unmark**     | An Unmark command will cause a previously submitted Assignment to be reset to "not submitted". If the assignment was previously graded, the score will be reset by default.                                                                               |
| **Mark**       | A Mark command will cause an unsubmitted Assignment to be marked as Submitted. The grade will remain as "not submitted yet", until a Grade Command is performed.                                                                                          |
| **Grade**      | A Grade command will assign a score to an assignment. This score must be within the valid range of 0 to the maximum score of the assignment. When the grade command executes, the submission status of the assignment will also be marked as "submitted". |

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add_student n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add_student n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Science` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Science`, `t/Math t/English` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* To prevent Java integer overflow issues, all integer values—including indices and scores—must be within the range of -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

TAchy data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TAchy data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TAchy will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TAchy to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TAchy home folder.

**Q**: What are the system requirements for TAchy?<br>
**A**: TAchy requires Java 17 or above to run. It is compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems.

**Q**: Is it necessary to back up my TAchy data?<br>
**A**: Regularly backing up your addressbook.json data file is highly recommended. Save a copy in a secure location to ensure your data can be restored in case of unexpected software or hardware problems.

**Q**: What happens if I accidentally delete a student or an assignment?<br>
**A**: Deleted data cannot be recovered directly within TAchy. However, if you have a backup of your data file, you can restore it by replacing the current data file in the application folder with the backup.

**Q**: Can multiple users use TAchy on the same computer?<br>
**A**: Yes, but each user should maintain a separate data file to avoid overwriting each other's records.

**Q**: Does TAchy automatically save my progress?<br>
**A**: Yes, TAchy saves all changes automatically in the data file whenever you add, edit, or delete information.

**Q**: Can I use TAchy offline?<br>
**A**: Absolutely! TAchy is designed to work entirely offline, so you can manage student and assignment information without an internet connection.

**Q**: What should I do if I encounter an error or bug?<br>
**A**: Please report any issues through our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-1/tp/issues), including the steps to reproduce the bug and any error messages you receive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Student names cannot include the symbol '/'**. Even if legal names include symbols (e.g: Suresh S/O Rama), TAchy will not be able to parse such names. Users are advised to instead remove such characters, or write the names in full (e.g: Suresh son of Rama)
