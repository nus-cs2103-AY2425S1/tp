--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be supplied by the user.
  e.g `delete STUDENT_ID` means the user has to enter the ID number of the student to be deleted.

* Every student added will be assigned a unique, non-modifiable `STUDENT_ID` that begins with S followed by a 5 digit 
number (e.g. S00003).
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-note">:memo: **Note:**
The `STUDENT_ID` of a student is non-replaceable once deleted. i.e. if you have one student with `STUDENT_ID
` S00001 and you delete that student, the next student you add will be assigned the next `STUDENT_ID` e.g. S00002 
(instead of replacing S00001).

</div>

* Parameters can be in any order.
  e.g. if the command specifies `n\NAME p\PHONE_NUMBER`, `p\PHONE_NUMBER n\NAME` is also acceptable.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g. `s\SUBJECT [s\MORE_SUBJECTS]` can be used as `s\SUBJECT` or `s\SUBJECT s\MORE_SUBJECTS`.

* Items with `...` after them can be repeated.
  e.g. `s\SUBJECT [s\MORE_SUBJECTS]...` can be used as `s\SUBJECT`, `s\SUBJECT s\SUBJECT`, `s\SUBJECT s\SUBJECT 
s\SUBJECT`.

* Item are compulsory unless specified as optional.
  e.g. `add n\NAME i\NRIC yg\YEARGROUP p\PHONE e\EMAIL a\ADDRESS s\SUBJECT [s\MORE_SUBJECTS]...` means that all
  parameters are compulsory except for `[s\MORE_SUBJECTS]`.

* Commands are case-sensitive (e.g., `add` is not the same as `Add`). Hence, commands should be in lowercase.

* Prefixes are case-sensitive (e.g., `n\` is not the same as `N\`). Hence, prefixes should be in lowercase.

* Parameters are case-insensitive (e.g., `Science`, `SCIENCE`, `science` are treated as the same) except for sort 
function.

* Leading and trailing spaces will be removed from the parameters. Hence, the length of the parameters is not affected 
by the leading and trailing spaces.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `tracksubject`,`help`, `list`, `exit` and 
`clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple
lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</div>

## Student Management
### Adding a student : `add`

Repeated subjects will be ignored. For example, if you add `s\Science s\Science`, only one `Science` subject 
will be added.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-note">:memo: **Note:**
A student ID is automatically generated and assigned upon successful addition. It will be displayed in the success 
message and can be used for `addsubject`, `edit`, `detail` and `delete`.
</div>

Examples:
* `add n\Sam Tan i\T3848559A yg\3 p\81003999 e\samtan@gmail.com a\9 Smith Street \Science`

![Add Success Message](images/add.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Some contact fields such as address and email are intentionally hidden to avoid cluttering of information. To view all 
the details of a student, you can use the [detail command] (#viewing-a-students-detail--detail).

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Exceptionally long names will be cut off on the display, but you can read the student's full name using the 
detail command.
</div>

### Deleting a student : `delete`

Removes a student from the tuition center management system.

Format: `delete STUDENT_ID`

* `STUDENT_ID`: Should begin with S followed by a 5-digit, starting from 00001 to 99999.

  details.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-note">:memo: **Note:**
The `STUDENT_ID` of a student is non-replaceable once deleted. i.e. if you have one student with `STUDENT_ID S00001` and you delete that student, the next student you add will be assigned the next `STUDENT_ID` e.g. S00002 
(instead of replacing S00001).
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
This action is irreversible. Once a student is deleted, the student's details will be permanently removed from the
system.
</div>

Examples:
* `delete S00001`
  * Deletes the student with the ID S00001.

![Delete Success Message](images/delete.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing a student : `edit`

Format: `edit STUDENT_ID FIELD\NEW_VALUE`

* `STUDENT_ID`: Should begin with S followed by a 5-digit, starting from 00001 to 99999.
    * The ID of a student is automatically assigned when the student contact is first added and can be found by viewing the student's
      details.
* `FIELD`: Can be one of: Name(`n\ `), NRIC(`i\ `), Year Group(`yg\ `), Phone Number(`p\ `), Email(`e\ `), Address(`a\ `), or Subject 
taken(`s\ `).
* `NEW_VALUE`: Should follow the constraints of the specified field. You may refer to the constraints of each field 
in the [add feature](#adding-a-student--add) section or the [Command Parameters Reference](#command-parameters-reference) section.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-note">:memo: **Note:**
Although editing the NRIC is allowed, it must not match any other student's NRIC in the system. 
An error message will be shown if a duplicate is detected.

</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
When editing a contact, the previously saved value of FIELD will be replaced entirely by NEW_VALUE. e.g. 'edit S00001 
n\Henry Teo' replaces the name field of student S00001 with "Henry Tan". 

</div>

Examples:
* `edit S00001 a\New_Address`
  * Edits the address of the student with the ID S00001 to "New_Address".
* `edit s00002 p\91234567 a\New_Address`

"Adding subject(s) to a student" under "Subject Management" for more details. 
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
To delete a subject, you can use the edit command. e.g. student S00120 takes the subjects English and Math, but wishes to 
drop the subject English, you can use the command 'edit S00120 s\Math'.<br><br>

:exclamation: But note that the subject will be replaced entirely by the new subject.
For example, if the student is taking English and Math and you use the command 'edit S00120 s\Science', the student will
only be taking Science.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Subject Management
### Adding subject(s) to a student : `addsubject`

Adds one or more subjects to an existing student's record.

Format: `addsubject STUDENT_ID s\SUBJECT [s\MORE_SUBJECTS]...`

* `STUDENT_ID`: Should begin with S followed by a 5-digit, starting from 00001 to 99999.
    * The ID of a student is automatically assigned when the student contact is first added and can be found by viewing the student's
      details.
* `SUBJECT`: Only the subjects listed below are allowed.
    * Subjects available: English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil, Math, Further Math, Science, History, Geography, Literature, Economics, Accounting, Business, Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Computing.
* `[MORE_SUBJECTS]`: Optional, and you can add multiple subjects by repeating the `s\` field. The same constraints as `SUBJECT` apply.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-note">:memo: **Note:**
Repeated subjects will be ignored. For example, if you add `s\Science s\Science`, only one `Science` subject 
will be added.
</div>

Examples:
* `addsubject S00001 s\Science`
  * Adds the subject Science to the student with the ID S00001. 
* `addsubject S00002 s\Science s\Math`
  * Adds the subjects Science and Math to the student with the ID S00002.

### Tracking student count for each subject : `tracksubject`

Displays a window that shows how many students are taking each of all the subjects.

Format: `tracksubject`

* The subject count will be displayed in a pop-up window.
* User may use keyboard shortcut `B` to close the pop-up window.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-note">:memo: **Note:**
Track subject displays the number of students based on the filtered list. For example,
filtering by year 2 students followed by a `tracksubject` command will only show how many year 2 students 
are taking each of the subjects.
</div> 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** 
The subject tracker must be closed and reopened to refresh the data. If you filter the list and then run the 
`tracksubject` command without closing the pop-up, subsequent commands like `list` will not update the subject tracker. 
Please ensure to close the tracker to view the most current information.

# Data Management in AcademyAssist

Welcome to the Data Management section of AcademyAssist! Here, we'll explain how your important information
is stored and managed.

## How Your Data is Saved

Don't worry about constantly saving your work - AcademyAssist has got you covered! Here's what you need to know:

1. **Automatic Saving**: Every time you make a change, like adding a new student or updating information,
AcademyAssist saves it right away. You don't have to do anything!

2. **Where Your Data Lives**: All your information is safely stored on your computer in a special file.
It's like a digital filing cabinet just for AcademyAssist.

3. **Easy to Understand**: We use a format called JSON to store your data. While you don't need
to know the details, it's designed to be easy for both computers and humans to read if needed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Keeping Your Data Safe

Your information is important, so here are some tips to keep it secure:

1. **Make Backups**: It's always a good idea to have an extra copy of your data. Once a week,
why not copy your AcademyAssist file to a USB drive or cloud storage?

2. **Be Careful with Editing**: While it's possible to open and edit the data file directly, we don't recommend
it unless you're an expert in CLI applications. It's safer to make changes through the AcademyAssist program.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** 
Be aware that if your modifications to the data file create an invalid format, Academy Assist will erase all existing
data and start with a blank data file the next time it runs. To prevent data loss, it is advisable to back up the file 
before making any changes.<br><br>
Additionally, certain alterations may cause Academy Assist to function improperly (for instance, if a value entered is
outside the permissible range). Only edit the data file if you are sure you can do so accurately.
</div>

## What If Something Goes Wrong?

Don't panic! AcademyAssist is designed to handle most issues smoothly. But if you do run into problems:

1. **Check for Messages**: If there's an issue loading your data, AcademyAssist will show a helpful
message explaining what's wrong.

2. **Use Your Backup**: This is where your backup copy comes in handy. You can replace the problematic
file with your backup to get back on track.

Remember, AcademyAssist is here to make managing student information easy and stress-free.
If you ever have questions about your data, just ask - we're always happy to help! You can reach us via our email 
(academyassist@gmail.com).

# FAQ
This section provides answers to frequently asked questions about AcademyAssist. If you have any other questions or
encounter issues while using the application, please feel free to reach out to us via our email (academyassist@gmail.com).

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous AcademyAssist folder.<br><br>

**Q**: Why is there a gap in the studentID after I deleted a student?<br>
**A**: This is an intentional design, kindly refer to the note under [Features](#features) for more details.<br><br>

**Q**: Why do the system doesn't replace the studentID of a deleted student?<br>
**A**: This is an intentional design. Setting the studentID as irreplacable ensures data consistency and integrity,
similar to a primary key in a database, by preventing duplicate or erroneous entries. <br><br>

**Q**: Why is the maximum studentID capped at S99999?<br>
**A**: The maximum student ID is capped at S99999 to meet the needs of small and medium-sized tuition centers. This 
limit is sufficient for managing hundreds of students while providing a safe buffer for growth over the years. 
As student IDs are irreplacable, this capacity remains adequate even with operations such as deleting student records.<br><br>

**Q**: Some of the subjects I want to add are not available. How can I add them?<br>
**A**: Currently, the system only supports a predefined set of subjects. However, we are working on a feature that will
allow users to create their own subjects. Stay tuned for updates on this feature!<br><br>

**Q**: How can I view the full list of students after filtering or sorting?<br>
**A**: You can use the `list` command to view the full list of students after filtering or sorting. This command will
reset the list to display all students in the system.<br><br>

**Q**: Why is the subject tracker not updating after filtering the list?<br>
**A**: The subject tracker must be closed and reopened to refresh the data. If you filter the list and then run the
`tracksubject` command without closing the pop-up, subsequent commands like `list` will not update the subject tracker.

**Q**: I can't see the full details of a student in the main window. How can I view all the details?<br>
**A**: Currently, we only display the student's name, student ID, year group, subjects taken, and phone number in the 
main window for a cleaner user interface. To view more detailed information about a student, you can use the `detail` 
command followed by the student's ID. This will provide you with all the additional details you need.<br><br>

# Upcoming Features
As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance the functionality of the student management system, we are excited to 
introduce the following features aimed at providing greater flexibility in subject management:

1. **Create Subject**: Allow users to create their own subjects. Currently, the application only permits a restricted
set of predefined subjects. With this feature, users will be able to tailor the subjects offered in their tuition center
based on their specific needs.
<br><br>
2. **Delete Subject**: Enable users to delete subjects that are no longer offered by the tuition center. This feature
will also automatically remove the subject tag from students currently enrolled in that subject, ensuring accurate and
up-to-date records.
<br><br>
3. **Drop Subject**: Allow users to modify the subjects taken by students by dropping a subject. Currently, the system
only supports adding subjects, and if a user wants to remove a subject from a student’s record, they must use the edit
feature and manually note the remaining subjects. This new feature will streamline the process and enhance usability.
<br><br>
4. **Add Remark**: Enable users to add remarks or comments to student contacts in the future. This feature will allow 
users to tag additional information, such as notes about missed payments or other important details, to specific 
students. By implementing this functionality, we aim to improve communication and record-keeping, making it easier for 
users to manage student interactions effectively<br><br> 

These planned features are designed to improve the administrative capabilities of our student management system, allowing for more efficient subject management. We welcome your feedback and suggestions as we work towards implementing these enhancements!
