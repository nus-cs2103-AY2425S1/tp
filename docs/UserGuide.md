# LogiLink User Guide

LogiLink is an all-in-one management tool designed for you, a logistics coordinator/manager, to efficiently manage your contacts and their associated delivery information from your desktop.
Using only keyboard commands, you can easily add, edit, find, sort, and organize contacts, track delivery details and statuses, archive past transactions (— and much more!).

If you type fast, you can complete your contact and delivery management tasks faster with LogiLink than with mouse-based apps.

Currently, LogiLink is targeted towards a Singaporean userbase, with international support planned for future iterations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.
    - If you do not, you can download the Java `17` installer from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the `.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for LogiLink.

1. Within this _home folder_, open a command terminal (Right-click > Open in Terminal) and enter `java -jar LogiLink.jar` to run LogiLink.<br>
    - For example you select _LogiLink_ as your _home folder_. By right clicking in the empty space, you should see the dropdown below. Click on Open in Terminal.<br>
      <img src="images/openinterminal.png" alt="openinterminal" width="600">

    - A window similar to the diagram should appear, and the program should contain some sample data.<br>
      <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="ui" width="600">

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all contacts.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com r/Client a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the contacts list.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**
1. There are two windows in this program:
- **Main window**: the default window you see when opening LogiLink.
  <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="ui" width="600">


- **Inspect window**: the window you see when inspecting a contact.
  <img src="images/Ui2.png" alt="ui2" width="600">
  <br></br>

2. Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters you need to provide.<br>
    * Eg. `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is where you would enter a name, like `add n/John Doe`.

1. Square brackets [ ] indicate the parameter is optional.<br>
    * Eg. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` means you can enter either `n/John Doe t/friend` or `n/John Doe`.

1. Ellipsis `...` means you can repeat the parameter multiple times, or leave it out completely.<br>
    * Eg. `[t/TAG]…​`lets you add any number of tags like `t/friend` or `t/friend t/family`, or you can skip the tags altogether.

1. You can enter parameters in any order.<br>
    * Eg. If the command format is `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, then entering parameters in the order `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

1. Commands that do not require parameters (`help`, `list`, `exit`, `clear`) will ignore anything extra you type.<br>
    * Eg. If you enter `help 123`, it will simply run the `help` command and ignore the `123`.

1. If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines. Sometimes, the spaces around line-breaks may not copy correctly, which could cause issues when you paste them into
   the app.
   </box>

### Viewing help : `help`
**<ins>When in the main or inspect window**

<br>
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:**<br>

* In order to keep your address book organised, `NAME` has to be **unique**.

**Tip:** A contact or delivery can have as many tags as you like — even none!

### Listing all contacts : `list`
**<ins>When in the main window**

Shows a list of all contacts added to the contacts list. If the contact type is specified, it only shows the contacts with the specified type.

Format: `list [clients/employees]`

**<ins>When in the inspect window**

Shows a list of all deliveries added to a contact's delivery list.

Format: `list`

### Editing a contact or delivery: `edit`
**<ins>When in the main window**

Edits an existing contact in the contacts list.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [r/ROLE] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

    - The index is the number displayed next to the contact's name in the list.
    - The index **must be a positive number** (starting from 1).
* You must provide at least one optional field (in [ ]). This means you need to update at least one of the following fields: name, phone, email, role, address, or tag.
* Editing tags will replace **all** existing ones. If you simply want to remove all tags, type 't/' without specifying any tags after.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` changes the phone number and email address of the 1st contact to `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

* **Matches partial words**: e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`
* **"OR" search**: If a contact's name contains any of the keywords, it will be shown. e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`

### Archiving a contact or delivery : `archive`

Archived contact(s) will be less visible (greyed out) and moved to the bottom of the list.

### Saving the data

LogiLink data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

LogiLink automatically saves your data as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/LogiLink.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, LogiLink will erase all data and start with an empty data file on the next launch. To avoid losing your information, we recommended creating a backup of the file before making
any changes.<br>

Certain changes you make to the file could cause LogiLink to behave unexpectedly (e.g., entering an invalid value). So, only edit the data file if you are confident you can do so correctly.
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous LogiLink home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**
- If you are using multiple screens and move the app to a secondary screen, then later switch to using only the primary screen, the app might open off-screen.
- To fix this, simply delete the `preferences.json` file created by the app, then restart the app.
