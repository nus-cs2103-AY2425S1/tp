## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n\NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n\John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n\NAME [t\TAG]` can be used as `n\John Doe t\friend` or as `n\John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t\TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t\friend`, `t\friend t\family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n\NAME p\PHONE_NUMBER`, `p\PHONE_NUMBER n\NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

Name Constraints: <br>
* Names have to be unique, duplicates are not allowed, regardless of case. For example, `John Doe` and `john doe` would be considered duplicates and if one is already in the address book, the other will not be allowed to be added. We suggest adding some additional information to differentiate your contacts from one another, such as `John Tan NUS` instead of just `John Tan`
* Names must consist only of alphanumerics, spaces, forward slashes and apostrophes
* Names must not be longer than 200 characters

Phone Number Constraints: <br>
* Phone numbers must consist of digits `0` to `9`, with the option of a `+` sign at the beginning for the country code
* Phone numbers must not be more than 30 digits long
* Phone numbers cannot contain spaces

Email Address Constraints: <br>
* Email should be of the format `local@domain`
* `local` must only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (`+_.-`)
* `local` must not start or end with any special characters
* `domain` must only consist of alphanumeric characters, with no more than one hyphen (`-`) or period (`.`) in between any 2 alphanumeric characters.
* `domain` must end with at least 2 characters that are not a period (`.`)
* Duplication is not prevented/checked for, as it might be possible for some of your users' clients to be contacted through the same contact, e.g. a common secretary.

Address Constraints: <br>
* Address can take any characters except for `\`, but cannot be blank

Financial Info Constraints: <br>
* Financial Info can take any valid characters except for `\`
* If multiple Financial Info entries are provided, only the last one will be recorded. For example, in `fi\high income fi\millionaire` only `millionaire` will be stored

Social Media Handle Constraints: <br>
* Social Media Handle can take any valid characters except for `\`
* If multiple Social Media Handle entries are provided, only the last one will be recorded. For example, in `s\@john123 s\@john456` only `@john456` will be stored

Tag Constraints: <br>
* A person can have any number of tags (including 0).
* A tag can be added with or without a value. For example, `t\client` and `t\insurance:No` are both valid tags.
* Only alphanumeric characters (alphabets and numbers) are supported in tag names.
* For tag values, only alphanumeric characters and periods in between numbers (eg `2.4`) are supported.
* Multiple of the same tags are not supported for a single contact. For example, `t\policy` and `t\policy: 223302B` would not be supported for a single contact.
* Negative numbers are not supported in tag values
* Operations such as `+, -, *, /` are also not supported in tag values
* Reserved tags are not allowed to be added manually via commands like `add` or `edit`
  * For BA€, `DuplicatePhone` is a reserved tag name, manually adding variations with different capitalisation of letters (e.g. `duplicatePhone`, `dUpLiCaTePhOnE`) or adding tags with will give an error
  * Tags with values but have the same name as reserved tags are also not allowed (e.g. `t\DuplicatePhone:7`)

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How can I open my contact data in another application, such as Microsoft Excel?

1. Create a data export in your preferred file format.
    * For CSV exports: type the command `export format\csv` or click `Export` > `Export to CSV`.
    * For TXT exports: type the command `export format\txt` or click `Export` > `Export to TXT`.
    * A confirmation message will appear onscreen after the export is complete.
2. Navigate to the folder where BA€ was installed.
3. Open the `/data/` folder.
4. Open your data export file (`bae_addressbook.csv`/`bae_addressbook.txt`) in your application of choice.

**Q**: How can I open my data in BA€ on a different computer?

1. Install BA€ on your secondary computer.
2. Copy your data file (`bae_addressbook.json`) from BA€'s `/data/` folder on your primary computer.
3. Paste the copied data file in BA€'s `/data/` folder on your secondary computer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **If you accidentally press the alt key (Windows, Linux) or option key (MacOS)** on your keyboard while typing a command, the arrow keys will no longer navigate the command box. To rectify this, press the alt/option key again.
4. **If you add very long names, tags, or other information** (> 80 characters) to contacts, and the application window is not wide enough to display the entire line of text, the text will be truncated with `...` at the end.
5. **If you want to add tags to an existing contact**, you need to type in all existing tags to retain them.
6. **If you use have a previous export's file open and try to export again** on a Windows computer, you will encounter an error. To rectify this, close the previous export's file and try again.
