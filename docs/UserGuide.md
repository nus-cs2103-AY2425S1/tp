## Quick start

1\. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer.

2\. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/releases).

3\. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your CareConnect application.

4\. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar careconnect.jar`
   command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. To get started, you can play around with some of the sample data that the app comes with!<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5\. Note that CareConnect is best viewed in a **desktop** environment with **full screen**. You may see some
   content being cut-off if the window size is too small.

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

6\. Let's try opening up a contact with the `view` command!

   - As you type, notice that an invalid command word will be coloured in red.

       ![incomplete command](images/syntax_highlighting_1.png){: width="340" }
   - You can try autocompleting the command by pressing `TAB` on your keyboard too. In this case, the command `view` will be matched, and it will be displayed in grey to indicate that it's a valid command word that is waiting for an argument.
   
       ![valid_command](images/syntax_highlighting_2.png){: width="340" }
   - In this case, `view 1` indicates that we want to view the first contact in the list. Once a full valid command is entered, the command will be colored black.<br>
       
       ![complete command](images/syntax_highlighting_3.png){: width="340" }
   <div style="page-break-after: always"></div>
   - Press Enter to execute command, and you should see the details for the first contact `Alex Yeoh` appear on the right pane!
   ![view command result](images/quickStart_1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

7\. Let's delve a little deeper now, try adding a new contact using `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`. This adds a contact named `John Doe` to the application.

![add new person](images/quickStart_addNew.png){: width="550" }

8\. You can use `shift+tab` to navigate between your command box and the contact list. You will see a brown box around the list when it is selected.
Try using the arrow key to navigate around the list until you find `John Doe`.

![shift tab](images/quickStart_shiftTab_2.png){: width="550" }

9\. To add a new log entry for John, try `addlog 1 r/First meetup. d/2019-10-15 14:00`. You can add multiple logs for
the same contact, and the logs will appear as a list on the right.

![logs](images/quickStart_log_2.png){: width="550" }

10\. Finally, to delete a contact, simply use `delete <id>`. In this case, John has an id of 6 (visible from the contact list), so we can run `delete 6` to delete his contact.

11\. For security, you will be prompted to confirm your delete command. Press `y` to confirm, or `n` to cancel.

![delete](images/quickStart_delete_1.png){: width="550" }

<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>

12\. Confirm that the contact has been removed from the list on the right.
   ![delete finished](images/quickStart_delete_2.png)
13\. That's all! Feel free to refer to the [Features](#features) below for more details on each command and other features included in CareConnect.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Invalid specifiers might cause unexpected behavior.
  e.g. If the command only accepts `n/`, `a/`, and `t/` specifiers, then additional specifiers like `u/` or `e/` might cause unexpected behavior (eg. error messages that do not make sense, or the specifier might be ignored).

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* `find a/ serangoon` will return `Bernice Yu` with address `Blk 30 Lorong Serangoon Gardens, 
  #07-18` and `David Li` with address `Blk 436 Serangoon Gardens 26, #16-43`.
* `find a/ cl av` will return `Carl` with address `Blk 777 Clementi Ave 2`.

### Syntax Highlighting
CareConnect provides visual feedback to help users recognize and correct commands by highlighting text in different colors.

### Editing the data file

CareConnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are
welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, CareConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause CareConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CareConnect home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
