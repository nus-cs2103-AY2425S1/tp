# VBook User Guide

VBook is a **desktop application for freelance software developers to store and organise client contact details and log client preferences.** VBook is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

VBook (VimBook) is inspired by the Vim editor, where users can edit, navigate, and program faster with the keyboard than using a mouse. Hence, our commands and theme are inspired by the style of Vim.

Software developers who type fast can get their contact management tasks done at lightning speed with VBook's keyboard-only navigation feature. With advanced privacy features like password protection and encryption, VBook ensures that software developers’ client details remain secure and confidential at all times.

## Quick Start

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** This document assumes familiarity with the command line, though it is not required.

</box>

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer. For Mac users, you should use the specific `Azul JDK 17` distribution following this [guide](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `{{ jarFile }}` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for VBook.

4. Open a command terminal, change directory (`cd`) into the folder you put the `{{ jarFile }}` file in, and use the `java -jar {{ jarFile }}` command to run the application.<br>

```shell
cd path/to/vbook
java -jar {{ jarFile}}
```

5. An initial dialog will appear to prompt you to set a new password.

![setPasswordDialog](images/setPasswordDialog.png){width=60%}


-  On subsequent logins, the password dialog will prompt you to enter the password that you set.

![enterPasswordDialog](images/enterPasswordDialog.png){width=60%}


6. A GUI similar to the screenshot below should appear upon successful login. The application contains some sample data for you to get familiar with the application.<br>

![VBook_annotated.png](images/VBook_annotated.png)

7) Type any command in the Command Box and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to execute it. For example, typing **`:help`** and pressing <kbd>ENTER</kbd> will open the help window.

<box type="info" seamless>
    The application contains sample contacts. To remove them, type <code>:clear</code> and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>.
</box>

For a summary of all our commands, refer to this table below:

    {{ commandSummary }}

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* All commands are in lowercase.

* Words in `UPPERCASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `:add -n NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `:add -n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `-n NAME [-t TAG]` can be used as `-n John Doe -t friend` or as `-n John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used any number of times.<br>
  e.g. `[-t TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `-t friend` (i.e. 1 time), `-t friend -t family` (i.e. 2 times) etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-n NAME -p PHONE_NUMBER`, `-p PHONE_NUMBER -n NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `:help`, `:list`, `:quit` and `:clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `:help 123`, it will be interpreted as `:help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the parameters:**<br>

* Some parameters have restrictions on the values they accept:

    * **Names** should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it should not be blank.
    * **Phone numbers** should only contain numbers, and it should be at least 3 digits long. Duplicates are allowed because a single phone number may be used by multiple people, such as a company number.
    * **Emails** should be of the format local-part@domain and adhere to the following constraints:
        1. The local-part should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (`+_.-`). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
        2. This is followed by a '@' and then a domain name. The domain name is made up of domain labels separated by periods.
           The domain name must:
            - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long
            - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters
            - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.
    * **Locations** can take any values.
    * **Tags** should be alphanumeric, only one word long, and under 50 characters.
    * **Remarks** should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces.
    * **Phone numbers**, **Emails**, **Locations**, **Tags** and **Remarks** can be shared by contacts. This is because people in an organisation may share the same information.

### Privacy and Security

<br>

#### Password Prompt
**Initial Setup:**
When you launch VBook for the first time, you’ll be prompted to create a new password. This password will be used to control access to your address book.

<box type="info">

**Info:**
The password will be hashed with a salt and saved into a `password.txt` file stored in the same directory as `{{ jarFile }}`.

</box>

**Subsequent Logins:**
Each time you open VBook, you’ll be prompted to enter your password. This ensures that your data remains secure and accessible only to authorized users.

<box type="warning">

**Caution:**
If you forget your password, there is no way to retrieve your data. To re-enter the application, you can delete the `password.txt` file located in the same directory as `VBook.jar`.
However, deleting this file will also permanently erase all your address book data. This safeguard is designed to prevent unauthorized users from bypassing the password prompt.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Store your password in a secure place to avoid losing access to your data.

</box>

<br>
<br>

#### Encryption
**How it Works:**

- When you enter your password during the initial setup, it generates an encryption key saved as `vbook.jks` stored in the same directory as `{{ jarFile }}`.
- All your address book data is encrypted using this key and saved securely on your device.
- Each time you open the app, the password is used to decrypt the data for access.

<box type="info" seamleass>

**Info:**
Encryption only happens the first time you make changes to the address book from the VBook GUI. Loading a JSON file to your directory will not automatically encrypt the file.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## File Management

<br>

### Save Data

> VBook data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to
> save manually.

<br>
<br>

### Edit Data File

> The encrypted VBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/vbook.json`.

<box type="warning">

**Caution:**
Do not make changes to the encrypted JSON file, as it can corrupt the data and make it unreadable. If you want to manually edit the data file, follow these instructions:

1. Export your data by running `:export`.
2. Overwrite the empty data file in the new computer's `data/vbook.json` with the `vbook.json` file from your export in Step 1.
3. Run VBook and your modified data should appear.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Note:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, VBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the VBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g. if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: To transfer your data over, follow these steps:
1. Export your data from your current computer by running `:export`.
2. Install VBook in the other computer (refer to [Quick Start](#quick-start) for more information).
3. Overwrite the empty data file in the new computer's `data/vbook.json` with the `vbook.json` file from your export in Step 1.
4. Run VBook and your data should appear in your new computer.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Note:** Your data in your new VBook application will only be encrypted when you make a change to it in the application, through commands (i.e. `:add`, `:edit`).


</box>


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `:help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut <kbd>F1</kbd>) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
