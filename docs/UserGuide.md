# Talentcy User Guide

Talentcy is a **desktop app for managing job applicant contacts and monitoring their interview stages, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Talentcy can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

The codebase of Talentcy originates from AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) developed by CS2103 team.

## Quick start
<!-- Guide on checking Java version and running the application in different operating systems below inspired from: https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t13-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start -->
1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.
   - To check your Java version, you can follow the instructions [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html)
   .
   - If your computer doesn’t have Java 17 or a newer version installed, you can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Talentcy app.

4. **Windows**: Navigate to the home folder and right-click within the area highlighted in green in the image below. Select "Open in Terminal" from the menu. When the terminal window opens, enter `java -jar Talentcy.jar` to start the application.
   <p align="center">
   <img src="images/Windows_open_terminal.jpg" alt="Windows_open_terminal" width="350"/>
   </p>

   **MacOS**: 
       Right click on the homefolder. Then select "New terminal at Folder". A terminal will pop up. Type `java -jar Talentcy.jar` and press enter.
       <p align="center">
       <img src="images/Mac_open_terminal.png" alt="Mac_open_terminal" width="350"/>
       </p>

   **Linux**:
       Open the folder where you placed the Talentcy.jar file.
       Right-click inside the folder and select "Open in Terminal" (or use the Ctrl + Alt + T shortcut to open the terminal, then navigate to the folder using the cd command).
       In the terminal, type `java -jar Talentcy.jar` and press Enter.

A GUI should appear in a few seconds. Shown below is the annotated GUI. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
![Ui](images/Annotated-GUI.jpg)


5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all persons.

    * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com j/SWE123 t/A r/good ethic` : Adds a person.
    * named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

    * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd person shown in the current list.

    * `clear` : Deletes all persons.

    * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

<box type="info" seamless>

Notes:<br> When you open the app, a GUI will appear with a few sample persons already loaded, so you can immediately see the app in action.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
    e.g `n/NAME [r/REMARK]` can be used as `n/John Doe r/have pHD` or as `n/John Doe`.
* If a list of optional items separated by | are together wrapped in curly braces, exactly one item or at least one item are needed, depending on the presence of + after the curly braces. 
    e.g. `{[n/NAME] | [p/PHONE] | [e/EMAIL]}` means exactly one of the fields is needed.
    e.g. `{[n/NAME] | [p/PHONE] | [e/EMAIL]}+` means at least one of the fields is needed.
* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Format:
`massreject {[j/JOB CODE] | [t/TAG]}+`

* Updates person's tags to `r` (rejected) based on the specified criteria.
* You can filter by job code only, tag only, or a combination of both.

### Sorting persons by fields: `sort`

Sorts the list of persons based on specified fields in a case-insensitive manner. Sorting can be done by a single field or layered across multiple fields.

Format:
`sort [n/] [p/] [e/] [j/] [t/]`

* You can sort by any combination of name, phone, email, job code, and/or tag.
* Sorting is case-insensitive.
* Sorting by tag will be in the order: N, BP, BC, TP, TC, A, R

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Talentcy home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
