## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets `[ ]` are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. not included), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Items without `…`​ after them should not be inputted multiple times in the command.

* Parameters can be in any order unless otherwise stated.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* To avoid being too verbose, some error messages may be simplified for brevity. For a list of valid inputs for each parameter, please refer to the [Glossary](#glossary).

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Suggestions and Autocompletion

The Command Box in MedConnect offers **suggestions** and **autocompletion** to assist users while typing commands. These features aim to enhance the command entry experience through reducing the need for memorising command formats and reducing the chance of errors.

### Suggestions

Suggestions provide visible hints about the expected command format as the command is entered.

![suggestion](images/Suggestion.png)

* If an incorrect entry is detected (e.g., type `adding` instead of `add`), the suggestion will be hidden to indicate a problem with the format.

**Examples** (words in brackets "()", are suggested by the system.)
* Typing `add` will show the expected format for adding a patient: `add (n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS ecname/EMERGENCY_CONTACT_NAME ...)` 
* Upon typing the slash commands (e.g. `n/` or `p/`), the suggestion only shows the parameter that needs to be filled or the next command once done. e.g `add n/(NAME)`, `add n/Saajid Shaik (p/PHONE)`
* Inputs that are prefixes to more than 1 command, will result in full syntax suggestions for those commands to be displayed and separated with a `|`. e.g. `fi(nd KEYWORD MORE_KEYWORDS | finddoc KEYWORD MORE_KEYWORDS)`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note**

While commands can be written in any order, the suggestion feature only follows the default order which puts related parameters together, analogous to how the contact details are displayed in the app.

You may notice that suggestion and autocomplete features almost always work, even without default ordering, but this is currently a feature-in-progress for future enhancement.

Additionally, suggestions for parameters will never be duplicated unless users manually deviates from autocomplete or suggestion by the system.

</div>

[↑ Back to top](#table-of-contents)


### Autocompletion

Autocompletion helps to complete partially typed commands by pressing the `Control` key.

![Autocomplete demonstration](images/autocomplete.gif)

* If an incorrect entry is detected (e.g., type `adding` or `ade` instead of `add`), autocompletion will be disabled to indicate a problem with the format.

**Examples**:
* Typing `ad` followed by pressing `Control` autocompletes the input to `add`.
* Typing `add` followed by pressing `Control` autocompletes the input to `add n/`.
* Typing `add n/Saajid Shaik` followed by pressing `Control` autocompletes the input to `add n/Saajid Shaik p/`.

Since autocomplete can only work on fixed syntaxes, `INDEX`,`KEYWORD` and variable attribute (e.g. `NAME` in commands `n/NAME`) cannot be autocomplete. Should users try to autocomplete, the input text turns red, indicating users to fill in their information as needed.

![red_error](images/red_autocomplete.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


### Viewing help : `help`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A patient can have any number of tags (including 0). Tags can be used to add short descriptions or categories to patients.
</div>

* You need not enter the prefix 'Dr' when typing `DOCTOR_NAME`. The app automatically adds the prefix `Dr` in front of the `DOCTOR_NAME` entered.
* Patients with the same `PHONE_NUMBER` will be flagged as duplicates and cannot be added to the address book.

**Examples**
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 ecname/Charlotte Lim ecphone/94681352 ecrs/daughter dname/Ronald Lee dphone/99441234 demail/ronaldlee@gmail.com`<br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Caution:**
<br>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
<br><br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous MedConnect home folder.

**Q**: How do I change the MedConnect home folder?<br>
**A**: The MedConnect home folder is set to the folder where the `medconnect.jar` file is located. If you want to change it, move the `medconnect.jar` file and all the files in the original home folder to the new folder.

[↑ Back to top](#table-of-contents)

## Known issues

1. When using multiple screens, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. If you minimize the Help Window and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

3. When typing commands in the CommandBox, inserting a space, e.g. `he lp` in between `he` and `lp`, will cause the suggestion and autocorrection to bug out and display incorrectly.

4. MedConnect supports up to 2,147,483,647 patient contacts. Attempting to add or edit more than this number of contacts may result in unexpected behaviour.

5. Adding a spaces after `/` for command identifiers such as `n/` or `p/` will cause suggestion to repeat. e.g. `add n/ hello world` (spacing between "/" and "h" will cause n/NAME to be suggested again)

### Valid Inputs for Patient parameters

A person is uniquely identified by their `PHONE_NUMBER`. Persons with the same `PHONE_NUMBER` will be flagged as duplicates and cannot be added to the address book.

An emergency contact is considered a duplicate if it has the same `EMERGENCY_CONTACT_PHONE` as another emergency contact. You should not edit an emergency contact to have the same phone number as another emergency contact of the same patient to prevent unexpected app behavior. If you edit an emergency contact to have the same name, phone and relationship as another emergency contact of the same patient, this is considered a duplicate emergency contact and will be automatically removed from the list.
