## Quick start

1. **Check Your Java Version**  
   Make sure Java **version 17** or above is installed on your computer. <br>

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Info:** Java is a software platform that lets you run certain types of applications, including `.jar` files. [Learn more about Java here](https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/whatis_java.xml).<br> <br> To check your current Java version, [learn more here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html). <br>[Download Java here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) if needed.


2. **Download MindMap**  
   Download the latest `.jar` file for MindMap from [this link](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/releases). <br>

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Info:** A `.jar` file is a single file that contains everything needed to run a program. Think of it like a zipped folder that, when opened, lets you start using the application right away. <br> <br> To run it, you just need Java installed on your computer.

3. **Choose a Folder**  
   Copy the `.jar` file to a folder you‚Äôd like to use as the home for your MindMap contacts.

4. **Open a Terminal**
   <br> 

> **‚ÑπÔ∏è Info:** We‚Äôll use the Terminal (or PowerShell on Windows) to enter a few simple commands to launch the MindMap app. 

    - **For Windows**:
        - Open the Start menu, type ‚ÄúWindows PowerShell‚Äù, and click on it to open.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Ben Tan`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [s/STATUS]` can be used as `n/Ben Tan s/LOW` or as `n/Ben Tan`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* All commmand flags are in lower case. <br>
  e.g. `l/` is the lower case of L and `i/` is the lower case of I

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

Our application uses Singapore‚Äôs NRIC system extensively for the Identity Number field `i/`. To ensure NRICs are valid, we‚Äôve included a simple verification feature. You can test this feature with sample NRIC number/FIN from the [provided list](#sample-nrics). 

</box>
<br>
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaning how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

**Format: `help`**
<br>
<br>

### Adding a patient: `add`

Adds a patient to the app.
* **After using `add`, type `confirm` to complete the action**. You can also use `cancel` if you change your mind. 
* Note that confirmation will expire after 1 operation. Typing any other commands other than `confirm` or `cancel` will cancel this operation.

**Format:** `add n/NAME i/IDENTITY_NUMBER p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS s/STATUS‚Äã`

* **NAME** only supports alphanumeric characters and spaces as it is only meant for you to identify patients. For example names containing s/o, you can replace it with 'son of'.

* **IDENTITY_NUMBER** has to be a **_valid NRIC_** (It must be 9 characters long, starting with 'S', 'T', 'F', or 'G', followed by 7 digits, and ending with a valid checksum letter (e.g. S1234567D).

* **PHONE_NUMBER** must be a valid Singapore mobile number. Our application only accepts mobile numbers, which should be 8 digits long and start with either '8' or '9' (e.g., 81234567 or 91234567).



Examples:
* `add n/Ben Tan i/S1234567D p/82226688 e/bentan@gmail.com a/Block 322 Jurong East Street 31, #01-01 s/NEW`
* `add n/Ally Lim i/S0022445F e/allylim@gmail.com a/12 Kent Ridge Drive p/92221100 s/NEW`
<br>
<br>

### Adding a log: `addlog`
Creates a new log entry for a specific patient. This command is typically used to keep track of sessions or important notes related to each session. 

**Format**: `addlog i/IDENTITY_NUMBER d/DATE l/LOG_ENTRY`
* **IDENTITY_NUMBER** refers to the unique identifier (e.g., NRIC or FIN) of the patient.
* **DATE** should be in the format `DD MMM YYYY`.
* **LOG_ENTRY** is a description of the session with the patient.

  Examples:
* `addlog i/S1234567D d/20 May 2024 l/This should be replaced with the details of the session` adds a log for the contact with NRIC `S1234567D` on the date `20 May 2024`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:**

1) For logs that requires input text to include some of our flags like `i/`, `d/` and `l/` please use `addentry` command instead.
2) `\n` characters will be interpreted as new lines in the `l/LOG_ENTRY` fields of both `addlog` and `addentry`. This format will be preserved in the detailed view of the log entry.
3) Log entries that contains purely `\n` characters will be treated as a non-text entry which will disallow you from saving it as a log.
4) Adding an older log is allowed, considering you may want to move your logs from a physical notebook to the application.
5) Adding a same log with different case will not be treated as a duplicate log entry. This is to allow for error correction in the log entry. For example, if you have entered `john checked in at clinic` and you want to correct it to `John checked in at clinic`, you can do so without any issues. But normally we do not expect the same log entry to be entered twice.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a log entry: `addentry`
Creates a **separate pop up window** to add new log entry for a patient, with the corresponding `i/IDENTITY_NUMBER` `d/DATE` previously inputted.

After entering the details, click the `Save` button to add the log entry to the patient's log list, `Cancel` to discard the log entry. Closing the window directly will also discard the log entry.
> **üí° Tip:** Alternatively, use **"Ctrl + Enter"** to save the log entry on Windows and **"Cmd + Enter"** on Mac.

**Format**: `addentry i/IDENTITY_NUMBER d/DATE`
* **IDENTITY_NUMBER** refers to the unique identifier (e.g., NRIC or FIN) of the patient.
* **DATE** should be in the format `DD MMM YYYY`.

Examples:
* `addentry i/S1234567D d/20 May 2024` opens a new window to add a log entry for the contact with NRIC `S1234567D` on the date `20 May 2024`.
   <br>
   <br>

  ![img.png](img.png)
<br>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:**

1) Compared to `addlog` this command allows you to type in flags like `i/`, `d/` and `l/` in the log entry field. This is useful when you want to include these flags in your log entry.
2) `\n` characters will be interpreted as new lines in the `l/LOG_ENTRY` fields of both `addlog` and `addentry`. This format will be preserved in the detailed view of the log entry.
3) This feature is intended to cater to power users who prefer a more detailed log entry. If you prefer a more straightforward log entry, you can use the `addlog` command directly.
4) Log entries that contains purely `\n` characters will be treated as a non-text entry which will disallow you from saving it as a log.
5) Adding an older log is allowed, considering you may want to move your logs from a physical notebook to the application.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing a patient : `edit`

Edits an existing patient in the app by patient's specified INDEX.
* **After using `edit`, type `confirm` to complete the action**. You can also use `cancel` if you change your mind.
* Confirmation will expire after 1 operation. If you do not input confirm or cancel, the operation will be cancelled by default.


**Format:** `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [i/NRIC] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [s/STATUS]‚Äã`

* Edits the patient at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶‚Äã
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st patient to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit S1234567D n/Benson Lim` Edits the name of the patient with the specified `NRIC` to be `Benson Lim`.
   <br>
   <br>

### Locating patients by name or NRIC: `find`

Finds patients whose names or NRIC contain any of the given keywords.

**Format:** `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* For Names:
  Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* For NRIC:
  Only the Full NRIC will be matched .e.g `S123` will not match `S1234567D`.
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)
<br>
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting a patient : `delete`

Deletes the specified patient from the app.

**Format:** `delete INDEX` or `delete i/IDENTITY_NUMBER`

* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶‚Äã
* **After using `delete`, type `confirm` to complete the deletion**. You can also use `cancel` if you change your mind.
* Confirmation will expire after 1 operation. If you do not input confirm or cancel, the operation will be cancelled by default.

Examples:
* `delete i/S1234567D` deletes the patient with NRIC S1234567D in the address book.
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd patient in MindMap.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st patient in the results of the `find` command.
  <br>
  <br>

* Confirmation will expire after 1 operation. If you do not input confirm or cancel, the operation will be cancelled by default.
> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This deletes **ALL** of the patient contacts and their respective session logs. This action is non-reversible.
<br>
<br>

### Confirming a command : `confirm`

Confirms the command that is currently being executed. This command is used to confirm the action for `add`, `edit`, `delete`, and `clear`.

Examples:
* `delete i/S1234567D` followed by `confirm` deletes the patient with NRIC S1234567D in MindMap.

Examples:
* `delete i/S1234567D` followed by `cancel` cancels the deletion of the patient with NRIC S1234567D in MindMap.
* `clear` followed by `cancel` cancels the clearing of the MindMap.
  <br>
  <br>

### Listing all patients : `list`

Shows a list of all patients in the app.

**Format:** `list`
<br>
<br>

### Listing Session logs: `logs`

Lists all logs of a specific patient. This command will change the window to show the list of logs for a specific patient.
Clicking on individual logs will show the full description of the log.

**Format**: `logs i/[IDENTITY_NUMBER]`

Example:
* `logs i/S3054081F` <br>
  ![result for 'logs i/S3054081F'](images/logsAlexResult.png)

</box>

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

**Format:** `exit`
<br>
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Saving the data

<br>
<br>

### Editing the data file

MindMap data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, MindMap will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the MindMap to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?**<br>
**A**: _Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous MindMap home folder. Alternatively you can add individual patient along with their logs if your sample size is small._ 

**Q: Can the new `M` FIN series introduced in Singapore From 1 January 2022 onwards be used?**<br>
**A**: _Unfortunately, no. Our application only supports the format of the **F** and **G** FIN series, and for the **S** and **T** series for the NRIC. Also note that while most valid NRIC/FIN are able to be recognised by our application, some would inevitably fail as the Singapore Government does not disclose the true method to verify NRIC/FIN._

**Q: Why can't I edit or delete logs?**<br>
**A**: _With regard to medical records, our research shows that it seems unethical to post-date or back-date medical information^(1)^. Moreover, our software is not designed to keep track of time stamps and medical information changes. As such there will be no way of detecting malicious practices. Hence, given the potential legal issues, we have decided to disallow the editing and deletion of logs._

_However, there are mechanisms in place to prevent accidental inputs. The existence of save buttons in `addentry` helps prevent accidental saves as well as the text box being designed in a way that completely disallows users from saving empty logs._

(1) Singapore Medical Council. (2016). Ethical Code and Ethical Guidelines. Section B3.6 and B4.5. <br>Retrieved from
https://www.healthprofessionals.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider2/guidelines/2016-smc-ethical-code-and-ethical-guidelines---(13sep16).pdf

**Q: Why is there a need for AddLogEntry when there is already AddLog?**<br>
**A:** _AddLogEntry is intended to cater to power users who prefer a more detailed log entry. If you prefer a more straightforward log entry, you can use the AddLog command directly. Additionally, AddLogEntry supports flags like i/, l/ and d/ which would be recognised as duplicate flags in AddLog._

**Q: Why does the system display a "duplicate contact" error when the patient's name I entered is different?**<br>
**A:** _The system identifies unique contacts by their NRIC rather than by their name. If 2 patients have the same NRIC, the system identifies them as duplicate contacts._

**Q: Why can I add session logs older than the current date?**<br>
**A:** _Since there is no way for import and export of data for now, this facilitates the manual transfer of data from existing solutions into our app._

**Q: Why are multiple logs allowed in the same day?**<br>
**A:** _Session logs may contain errors which only surfaces after the log is saved. As such you may need to add another session log on the same day to reference the incorrect log with amendments._

**Q: Why can I input non-alphanumeric characters into logs?**<br>
**A:** _Our priority is to mainly support alphanumeric characters only, but remains functionally flexible enough to support non-alphanumeric characters (like emojis or other languages). As such you should only use it only when necessary and with caution as it could break cause unexpected behaviours._

**Q: Why can't patient contacts be deleted automatically after being tagged as 'DISCHARGED'?**<br>
**A:** _The system is designed to keep a record of all patients, even after they have been discharged. This is to ensure that the patient's information is still accessible for future reference, or possible revisit. It is only when the data is requested to be deleted explicitly by the patient, only then it should be removed._

## Known Issues

1. **Application Opening Off-Screen on Single-Monitor Setup**  
   When using multiple screens, if the application is moved to a secondary screen and the setup later reverts to a single screen, the application may open off-screen.  
   > **Workaround**: Delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application, then restart the application.

2. **Help Window Remains Minimised**  
   If the Help Window is minimised and the `help` command is executed again (or the `Help` menu or `F1` keyboard shortcut is used), the existing Help Window will remain minimised without reopening or restoring. <br>
   > **Workaround**: Manually restore the Help Window from the minimised state.

3. **Unable to Navigate List Items with Tab Key**  
   When using the Tab key to navigate, individual items in lists (like the patient list) cannot be accessed.  
   > **Workaround**: Currently, there is no workaround for this.
 
4. **New Line Handling in Log Entry**   
   Entering "\n" in `addlog` or `addentry` will be treated as a new line. This feature is intended to allow flexible log formatting.
    > **Workaround**: This feature is intended

6. **Possible misleading error message when using invalid index**   
   Specifically, when entering `delete 0`, it will cause the system to display a invalid command format error, instead of a invalid index error.
    >**Workaround**: This is intended as stated in the command format, `INDEX` must be a positive integer and 0 is not a positive integer, therefore is not valid.

7. **Possible misleading error message when entering invalid command**    
   When entering an invalid command like: ` add n/John Doe i/S7783844I invalidStuff p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/311, Clementi s/NEW`, the system will display an invalid NRIC error. Due to how commands are parsed in MindMap, invalid input will be treated as part of their previous prefix component. (In this case, the invalid input is treated as part of `IDENTITY_NUMBER`)
    >**Workaround**: Check for possible invalid input near the parts indicated by the error.

8. **Possible misleading error message when entering extremely large indexes into delete**    
   When entering an invalid index like: `delete 100000000000`, the system will display an invalid command format error, instead of a invalid index error.
    >**Workaround**: Avoid using absurdly large indexes when using the delete command, which is impossible to reach in the current context.

9. **Random ordering for logs on the same day**    
   When multiple logs are added on the same day, logs of same date will be displayed in a random order. This is due to the way logs are stored in the system.
    >**Workaround**: There is no workaround for this issue. We do not expect multiple logs to be added on the same day unless for error correction purposes.

## **Stay Tuned: Future enhancements coming!**
New UI Arriving Soon!
![Ui](images/Ui.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

1. **Search by Sub-Strings**    
Currently, the `find` command only searches for exact matches. We plan to enhance this feature to allow you to search for sub-strings within names.

2. **Force execution of commands that require confirmation**     
To bypass confirmation for commands like `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `clear`, we plan to add a flag that allows you to force the execution of these commands.

3. **Individual session logs can be viewed in detail via a command**     
Currently, you have to either use your mouse to click on individual logs to view them in detail or hit the `tab` key multiple times with arrow key inputs. We aim to implement a command that enables you to view individual session logs in detail directly.

4. **Better import and export features**     
Currently we only support convenient import and export from our app. We plan to use CSV files for better compatibility with other software programs.

5. **Removal of Appointment date**     
The appointment date field will be removed, as future commands will automatically tag session logs with the current date and time from the device, improving logging efficiency and eliminating the need for manual entry.

6. **Implementation of Edit and Delete Log Commands**     
As we enhance the tracking of changes in session logs, our goal is to ensure full compliance with the code of conduct required by medical applications. We will only introduce edit and delete log commands once we are certain that they meet all necessary regulatory standards.

7. **Support for special characters in names**     
We plan to support special characters in names, such as hyphens, apostrophes and slashes, to ensure that all names are accurately represented in the application.
