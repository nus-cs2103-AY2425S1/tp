## Quick Start
### Step 1: Install Java
Before you can use InvenTrack, ensure you have Java version `17` or above installed in your Computer. Java helps you to run our app in your desktop.
To check if Java is installed:
  1. Open a command terminal using `cmd` in search (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux). <br> Alternate way to open terminal: right-click on the opened folder or desktop, select `Open in terminal` option.
  2. Type the following command and press Enter:
      ```
      java -version
      ```
If Java is installed, you should see the version number. <br> If Java is not installed, download it from the [official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17?er=221886).

### Step 2: Download InvenTrack
1. Get the latest version of InvenTrack by downloading the `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/releases).
2. Move the .jar file into the folder where you want to store your InvenTrack data (this will be your "home folder").

### Step 3: Navigate to the Folder
To run InvenTrack, you need to open your command terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the .jar file:
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
2. Use the `cd` command to change to the folder containing the `.jar` file. For example:
   - On **Windows:**
     ```
     cd Desktop\InvenTrack
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux:**
     ```
     cd ~/Desktop/InvenTrack
     ```
   Verify that your terminal is now pointing to the correct directory. The terminal prompt should show the folder name `(e.g. InvenTrack)`

### Step 4: Run the Application
To launch the application:
1. After step 3, type the following command and press Enter:
    ```
    java -jar inventrack.jar
    ```
2. After a few seconds, the InvenTrack application should open. A window similar to the one below should appear (note that some sample data may be pre-loaded in the app):
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

### Step 5: Start Using InvenTrack
You can now start using the application by typing commands into the command box. For example:

   * `add_supplier n/Kayla Beauty p/98136450 e/kaylab@hotmail.com a/Phoenix Cross Road, Hilton Avenue 6` : Adds a supplier named Kayla Beauty with respective phone, email and address.

   * `add_product n/Corn flour stk/50` Adds product named Corn flour with current stock level as 50

   * `view_product` : Helps you to view the current products in the system.

   * `view_supplier` : Lets you see the list of suppliers currently in the system.

   * `delete_supplier n/Kayla Beauty` : Deletes the supplier with the name 'Kayla Beauty'

   * `clear` : Deletes all the information about the suppliers and products in the system completely.

   * `exit` : Helps you to exit the app.

Refer to the [Features](#features) below to know more about the commands you could use in this app.

## **Notes about the command format and other information:**
> #### ‚ö†Ô∏è Placeholders in UPPER_CASE
> Words like `PRODUCT_NAME` and `SUPPLIER_NAME` are placeholders for information you need to provide.
> - **Example**: For `add_product n/PRODUCT_NAME`, replace the placeholder with actual values, such as `add_product n/Apples`.
> #### üìò Optional Items in Square Brackets
> Items in square brackets are optional.
> - **Example**: `add_product n/PRODUCT_NAME [stk/STOCK_LEVEL]` can be used as `add_product n/Apples` or as `add_product n/Apples stk/50`.
> #### üîÅ Repeating Items with `‚Ä¶`
> Items followed by **`‚Ä¶`** can be used multiple times or omitted.
> - **Example**: `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶` can be used as `¬†` (0 times), `t/beverage`, or `t/beverage t/important`, etc.
> #### ‚ùó Extraneous Parameters Ignored
> Commands that do not require parameters (such as `help`, `exit`, and `clear`) will ignore any extra inputs.
> - **Example**: Typing `help 123` or `help -10` will be interpreted as `help`.
> #### üì¶ Setting Current Stock to be Greater than Maximum Threshold
> - MAX_STOCK_LEVEL is the maximum number of products you would like to have in your store for a particular product, so it might happen that CURRENT_STOCK_LEVEL maybe greater than the former because of greater number of purchase order. This helps to suit real world implementation.

### Adding a supplier: `add_supplier` üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

First let us add your suppliers into the system. 
<br> To do this, use the given command format:

Format: `add_supplier n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã`

Here are a few examples to help you:
* `add_supplier n/Fresh Farms Ltd p/98765432 e/contact@freshfarms.com a/23 Orchard Street, Suite 5`
* `add_supplier n/Global Produce Inc e/globalproduce@example.com p/1234567 a/789 Harvest Ave, Level 2 t/Organic`

<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 15px; border-left: 6px solid #2196F3; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <strong>üìù Note:</strong>
    <ul>
         <li>A supplier can have any number of tags (including 0).</li>
         <li>Currently, there is no restriction in phone number format, so you can use numbers like (+65) 97136544 or even +91-97664 23668, according to any country-specific format you prefer.</li>
         <li>Email can be the same if different people from same company use same work email hence we don't check for duplicate in emails and phone number too, It is intended for future enhancements.</li>
         <li>No value allows usage of "/", so if you want to use "S/O" in names, it's better to use alternatives like "son of," as there is no length restriction for names.</li>
         <li>If you want to see the supplier you have added, use view_supplier to switch panel, as currently the UI would not show newly added supplier information.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="background-color: #e8f5e9; padding: 15px; border-left: 6px solid #4CAF50; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <strong>üí° Tip:</strong> If you made a mistake while entering a supplier's information, you can delete the supplier and add them again with the correct details.
</div>

### Adding a product : `add_product` üß∂

Now, let us add the products supplied in your store. 
This command will help you add the product information into the system.

<div style="background-color: #fff3e0; padding: 15px; border-left: 6px solid #FF9800; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important:</strong> If SUPPLIER_NAME is specified, supplier with that name must exist in system before product can be added.
</div>

<div style="background-color: #f0f8ff; padding: 15px; border-left: 6px solid #2196F3; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <strong>üìù Note:</strong> MAX_STOCK_LEVEL is the intended number of products you would like to have in your store for a particular product when you restock. This is to help tell the supplier what quantity is required. It might happen that CURRENT_STOCK_LEVEL maybe greater than this number because of greater number of purchase order. This helps to suit real world implementation.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: Why can we add stock level more than the maximum stock level(maximum threshold)?<br>
**A**: MAX_STOCK_LEVEL is the intended number of products you would like to have in your store for a particular product when you restock. This is to help tell the supplier what quantity is required. <br> It might happen that CURRENT_STOCK_LEVEL maybe greater than this number because of greater number of purchase order. This helps to suit real world implementation.

**Q**: Why do we have n/ and pr/ and su/ prefixes if they almost fulfill the same purpose?<br>
**A**: n/ prefix is used for the products and supplier names who are to be newly added to the system. But pr/ and su/ prefixes are for the commands for which the products and suppliers already exist in the system. This differentiating value helps in abstraction!

---

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
