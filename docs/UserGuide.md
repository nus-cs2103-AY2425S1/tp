MediContacts is a **desktop app for managing contacts of patients and doctors**, as well as **keeping track of their appointments.** Hence our app is targeted at and built for receptionists working in small clinics, who need to manage thousands of patients, doctors, and appointments.

It is **optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MediContacts can not only get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional systems adopted by clinics, but also efficiently keep track of appointments between registered doctors and patients.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your MediContacts App.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar MediContacts.jar` command to run the application. You may refer to the following video tutorials on how to run JAR files:
    - [For Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hv0UhoaA0eo) (Watch from 0:47 onwards)
    - [For macOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GspNQbJLfag) (Watch from 2:23 onwards)
    - [For Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVD9DIxs9Lo) (Watch full video)

    A GUI similar to that below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app will initially contain some sample data.<br>
   
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add-patient n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be supplied as `add-patient n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
The app can only save a maximum of 10,000 appointments. If the limit is reached, the app may react in unexpected ways.
Therefore, ensure that the data file is regularly archived to prevent data loss and any unexpected behaviour.
</div>

### Editing the data file

MediContacts data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[WORKING DIRECTORY]/data/addressbook.json`, where [WORKING DIRECTORY] is the directory the user is running the JAR file. Advanced users are welcomed to update the data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, MediContacts will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to save a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the app to behave in unexpected ways (e.g. if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you will update it correctly.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates there. Do this with the file that contains the data of your MediContacts app in your previous computer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
