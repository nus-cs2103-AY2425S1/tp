## Command Overview
<box type="tip" light>

<b>Tip:</b>

Refer to the <a href="#command-summary">Command Summary</a> for a table containing the full list of commands.
</box>

The commands you can use in KeyContacts are split into 3 different types:
   * [Student Commands](#student-commands)
   * [Lesson Commands](#lesson-commands)
   * [General Commands](#general-commands)

&nbsp;

Let's walk you through some basics of the command format.<br>

&nbsp;

Each command consists of a **command word**, and zero or more **parameters**.<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  **Example:** In `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* The parameter `INDEX` (e.g. in the command format `delete INDEX`) specifies the student to perform the operation on. 
`INDEX` refers to the index number shown **in the displayed student list** (at the top left of each student card). `INDEX` **must be a positive integer**, i.e. 1, 2, 3...

* Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  **Example:** `[g/GROUP]` can be omitted or used as `g/Group One`.

* Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  **Example:** `pn/PIECE…​` can be used as `pn/Moonlight Sonata`, `pn/Moonlight Sonata pn/Ode to Joy` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order (excluding `INDEX`, which must follow the command word).<br>
  **Example:** If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (i.e `help`, `list`, `undo`, `redo`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  **Example:** If the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.


<box type="warning" light >

**Caution:**

If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines. This is because some space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over.

</box>

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Student Commands

A student has a **name**, **phone number**, **address**, **grade level** and optionally, a **group**. <br> Students with
the same group name _(case-insensitive)_ will have synced [lessons](#lesson-commands).

<box type="info" light theme="primary">

**Note:**

Students with the same name _(case-insensitive)_ and phone number will be counted as **duplicate** students.
</box>
Listed below are the currently supported student commands.

Action     | Format, Examples
-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**[Add](#adding-a-student-add)**    | `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER a/ADDRESS gl/GRADE_LEVEL [g/GROUP]` <br> e.g. `add n/James Ho p/22224444 a/123, Clementi Rd, 1234665 gl/LCM 1`
**[Delete](#deleting-a-student-delete)** | `delete INDEX`<br> e.g. `delete 3`
**[Edit](#editing-a-student-edit)**   | `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [a/ADDRESS] [gl/GRADE_LEVEL] [g/GROUP]`<br> e.g.`edit 2 n/James Lee p/81234567`
**[Assign](#assigning-piano-pieces-to-a-student-assign)** | `assign INDEX pn/PIECE_NAME...`<br> e.g.`assign 1 pn/Moonlight Sonata pn/Canon in D`
**[Unassign](#unassigning-piano-pieces-from-a-student-unassign)** | `unassign INDEX [pn/PIECE_NAME]...`<br> e.g. `unassign 1 pn/Moonlight Sonata pn/Canon in D`

<br>
<br>

### Adding a student : `add`

Adds a student to the student directory.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER a/ADDRESS gl/GRADE_LEVEL [g/GROUP]`

* If a group is not provided, or left blank (`g/`), the student will not be assigned to any group.
* If an existing group is provided, the student will be assigned all the lessons of the other students in the group.

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 a/John street, block 123, #01-01 gl/LCM 1` adds a student named `John Doe` with phone number `98765432`, address `John Street, block 123, #01-01`, grade level `LCM 1`, and no group.

&nbsp;

* `add n/Mary Sue p/87654321 a/Mary avenue, block 51, #10-10 gl/ABRSM 1 g/Jack's Group` adds a student named `Mary Sue` with phone number `87654321`, address `Mary avenue, block 51, #10-10`, grade level `ABRSM 1` and group `Jack's Group`. Mary Sue will have `Jack's Group`'s lessons.

<box type="tip" light>

**Tip:**

Does the app keep telling you that you are trying to insert a duplicate student? Check that you are not entering a student that already exists in the directory! See our definition of duplicate students [here](#student-commands).
</box>
<br>
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting a student : `delete`

Deletes the specified student from the student directory.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the student at the specified `INDEX`.

Examples:
* `delete 2` deletes the 2nd student.

<box type="tip" light>

**Tip:**

If you accidentally deleted the wrong student, you can use the [undo](#undoing-the-last-command-undo) command to
revert your action.
</box>
<br>
<br>

### Editing a student : `edit`

Edits an existing student in the student directory.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [a/ADDRESS] [gl/GRADE_LEVEL] [g/GROUP]`

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`.

* Removing a student from a group also **removes all the student's lessons**.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* You must provide **at least one** of the optional fields.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 n/Jane Doe p/91234567` edits the name and phone number of the 1st student to be `Jane Doe` and `91234567` respectively.
*  `edit 1 n/Penelope g/` removes the 1st student from their group, while also editing their name to be `Penelope`.
*  `edit 2 g/Jack's Group` moves the 2nd student into the group `Jack's Group`. The 2nd student will also be updated to have `Jack's Group`'s lessons.

<br>
<br>

## Lesson Commands

Each student can have **one regular lesson** in the same timeslot every week. You can also create make-up lessons and cancel
lessons for each student. 

<box type="info" light theme="primary">

**Note:**

We mentioned [earlier](#student-commands) that students in the same group have synced lessons. So, all commands in this section will apply to the entire group of the targeted student.

</box>

<box type="tip" light>

**Tip:**

You can use the [list](#listing-all-students-list) command to clear the previous find results and display all students again!

</box>

<br>
<br>

### Sorting students : `sort`

Sorts students based on personal details.

Format: `sort [n/ASC or DESC] [p/ASC or DESC] [a/ASC or DESC] [gl/ASC or DESC] [g/ASC or DESC]`

* The **order** of prefixes **matters**. If there are ties in the first field, later fields will be used to tie-break.
* Only name, phone number, address, grade level and group are valid fields to sort by.
* The sorting order must be `ASC` (**ascending**) or  `DESC` (**descending**), and is _case-insensitive_.
* You must provide **at least one** of the optional fields.

To clear the sorting conditions, use the command `sort clear`.

Examples:
* `sort n/ASC` sorts the students by name in ascending order.
* `sort gl/DESC n/ASC` sorts the students by grade level in descending order, and tie-breaks using name in ascending order.

<box type="info" light theme="primary">

**Note:**

All sorting is performed in [ASCII order](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/ascii-sort), meaning lower-cased letters come after all upper-cased letters.<br>
e.g "A" comes before "B", but "a" comes after "B".

</box>

<br>
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the student directory.

Format: `clear`

![ClearCommand.png](images/ClearCommand.png)

<br>

<box type="tip" light>

**Tip:**

Accidentally used the `clear` command? No need to worry! You can use the `undo` command to revert your action! <br>
Do <b>NOT</b> exit out of the application before you undo, as you will lose your data permanently.

</box>

<br>
<br>

### Undoing the last command : `undo`

Undoes the last command that modified the student directory.

Format: `undo`

<box type="info" light theme="primary">

**Note:**

1. Undo only affects commands that **modify student entries**. <br>
   For example, if you ran the command `delete 1` to delete student `Alex Yeo`, followed by the command `find Bernice`, running `undo` will restore student `Alex Yeo`.

2. You can undo **multiple** commands in a row that modified the student directory.
</box>

<br>
<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Redoing the last undone command : `redo`

Restores any changes that were previously undone using the `undo` command.

Format: `redo`

<box type="info" light theme="primary">

**Note:**

1. If you make another change to **student entries** after an `undo` command, you can no longer revert that `undo` command.<br>
For example, if you ran `delete 2`, then `undo`, then `delete 1`, you can no longer `redo` the `delete 2` command.

2. You can redo **multiple** changes in a row.
</box>

<br>
<br>

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## FAQ

**How do I save my data?**<br>
Student directory data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

<br>

**Help, why does it keep telling me that my date needs to be a valid date?**<br>
Firstly, make sure that your date exists (take note of the 29th of February on non-leap years).
Next, make sure that your date is following the `DD-MM-YYYY` format (pay attention to the hyphens in between). <br>
_Example: `30-10-2024` is allowed, while `30/10/2024` is not allowed._

<br>

**Can I edit the saved data file manually?**<br>
Student directory data is saved automatically as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/studentdirectory.json`. <br>Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" light>
<b>Caution:</b><br>

   * If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, KeyContacts will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
Hence, it is recommended to make a backup of the file before editing it.
   * Certain edits can cause KeyContacts to behave in unexpected ways 
(e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

<br>

**How do I transfer my data to another computer?**<br>
You can do so by copying the data file over to the other computer as follows:
1. Copy the `studentdirectory.json` file in the data folder over to the other computer.
2. Download KeyContacts in the other computer.
3. [Run KeyContacts](#quick-start) in the other computer. This will generate a `data` folder containing a sample `studentdirectory.json` file.
4. Replace this sample data file with the data file you copied from your previous computer.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.<br><br>
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
