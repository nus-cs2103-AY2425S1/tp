### 2.3 Notes on the Command Format

<box type="info" seamless>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g., in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Please avoid using the following reserved prefixes in parameters: `a/`, `e/`, `lt/`, `l/`, `n/`, `nt/`, `p/`, `s/`, `d/`, `t/`, `ti/`.
  Using these may sometimes result in unexpected behavior or errors.

* Names with multiple spaces are treated as if they contain a single space, and names are not case-sensitive.<br>
  e.g., `alex yeoh` and `Alex  yeoh ` are the same as `Alex Yeoh`.

* Overlapping lesson times will not be merged to provide flexibility for multiple schedules.<br>
  e.g., `lt/MON-15:00-17:00` and `lt/MON-16:00-18:00` will remain as separate entries.

* During comparison, addresses, task descriptions and notes with multiple spaces are treated as if they contain a single space, and comparison is not case-sensitive.<br>
  e.g., `nt/Test  1` and `nt/  TeST 1` are treated as the same.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g., `n/NAME [s/SUBJECT]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/MATH` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g., `[s/SUBJECT]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times) or `s/MATH` or `s/MATH s/PHYSICS` etc.<br>
  e.g., `[lt/LESSON_TIME]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times) or `lt/SUN-11:00-13:00` or `lt/SUN-11:00-13:00 lt/WED-17:00-19:00` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `viewtasks`, `clear`, `help` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### 3.1 Student Management

#### 3.1.1 Adding a Student: `add`

Adds a student to EduManage.

**Format:** `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMERGENCY_CONTACT a/ADDRESS [l/LEVEL] [s/SUBJECT]…​ [lt/LESSON_TIME]…​`
* A level must be assigned to a student either in the same command or in an earlier command before they can be assigned a subject.
* Lesson times across all students and within each student's schedule are allowed to overlap to accommodate different schedules on alternate weeks.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** A student can have any number of subjects and lesson times (including 0).
</box>

**Examples:**
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/99999999 a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe s/MATH e/88888888 a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 l/S1 NA s/ENGLISH lt/SAT-11:00-13:00 lt/SAT-11:30-13:30`

***

#### 3.1.2 Deleting a Student: `delete`

Deletes the specified student from EduManage.

**Format:** `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​ .

**Examples:**
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd student in EduManage.
* `find n/Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st student in the results of the `find` command.

***

#### 3.1.3 Updating a Student: `update`

Updates the details of an existing student in EduManage.

**Format:** `update NAME [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMERGENCY_CONTACT] [a/ADDRESS] [nt/NOTE] [l/LEVEL] [s/SUBJECT]…​ [lt/LESSON_TIME]…​`

* Updates the student with the specified `NAME`. The name refers to the full name shown in the displayed student list.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* A level must be assigned to a student either in the same command or in an earlier command before they can be assigned a subject.
* Lesson times across all students and within each student's schedule are allowed to overlap to accommodate different schedules on alternate weeks.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
When updating a note, subjects or lesson times, the existing note, subjects or lesson times of the student will be replaced i.e. updating of note, subjects or lesson times is not cumulative.
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**
* To remove a note for a student, simply type `nt/` without adding any text after it.
* To remove all the student’s subjects, simply type `s/` without specifying any subjects after it.
* To remove all the student’s lesson times, simply type `lt/` without specifying any lesson times after it.
</box>

**Examples:**
* `update Alex Yeoh p/91234567 e/99999999` updates the phone number and emergency contact of `Alex Yeoh` to be `91234567` and `99999999` respectively.
* `update Alex Yeoh n/Betsy Crower s/` updates the name of `Alex Yeoh` to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing subjects.
* `update Alex Yeoh lt/` clears all existing lesson times for `Alex Yeoh`.

***

#### 3.1.4 Finding Students: `find`

Find students by either their name, level or subject(s).

**Format:**
1. `find n/NAME [NAME]…​`
1. `find l/LEVEL`
1. `find s/SUBJECT [SUBJECT]…​`

* The search is case-insensitive and treats multiple spaces as one space. e.g., `hans` will match `Hans` and `s2   nt` will match `S2 NT`.
* For name and subject searches, the order of the keywords does not matter. e.g., `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* For name and subject searches, students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g., `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.
  e.g., `MATH CHEMISTRY` will return students with `MATH` or `CHEMISTRY`.

**Examples:**
* `find n/John` returns `john` and `John Doe`.
* `find l/S3 NA` returns all students tagged with level `S3 NA`.
* `find s/MATH` returns all students tagged with subject `MATH`.
* `find s/Math chemistry` returns all students tagged with subjects `MATH` or `CHEMISTRY`.
* `find n/alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`.<br><br>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:** Tagging with only subject(s) will only work if the student has a level assigned previously. Additionally,
the subject(s) tagged must be valid for the previously assigned level. Furthermore, when tagging subjects, the existing 
subjects of the student will be replaced i.e. tagging of subjects is not cumulative.

</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:** 
* To tag multiple subjects, use the format `s/FIRST_SUBJECT s/SECOND_SUBJECT …​`.
* To clear all existing level and subject tags, use `l/NONE NONE`.

### 3.3 Data Management

#### 3.3.1 Saving the Data

EduManage data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

***

#### 3.3.2 Editing the Data File

EduManage data are saved automatically as a [JSON file](#6-glossary-table) `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Users are not advised to edit the data file directly.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, EduManage will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the EduManage to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## 4. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous EduManage home folder.

**Q**: How do I recover data if I accidentally `clear` all students?<br>
**A**: Unfortunately, the `clear` command is irreversible. Ensure you regularly back up the data file stored at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` to prevent accidental data loss.

**Q**: How do I back up my data?<br>
**A**: Copy the data file located at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` to a secure location. This file contains all student and task information.

**Q**: What should I do if the GUI opens off-screen?<br>
**A**: Delete the `preferences.json` file located in the same folder as `EduManage.jar`, then restart EduManage. This should reset the GUI window position.

**Q**: Is there a way to search for students based on multiple attributes at once (e.g., `name` and `subject`)?<br>
**A**: Currently, searches are limited to one attribute at a time. You can, however, perform multiple searches sequentially to filter results.

## 5. Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the [GUI](#6-glossary-table) will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file (found in the same folder as `EduManage.jar`) created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Names** with special characters such as `/` and `,` are not allowed. As such, valid names such as `Aditi D/O Ramesh`
    and `Tan Jun Wei, Justin` will be considered invalid. To work around this issue, we recommend simply omitting the
    special character(s) or adding a space (e.g., `Aditi D O Ramesh`, `Tan Jun Wei Justin`). This restriction does not apply for less restrictive
    parameters, such as task description and note.
4. Long inputs for fields such as name, note and address may get cut off even if window is fully maximized. To view the full content,
   use the `view` command.
