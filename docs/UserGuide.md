# 2. Setting up VendorVault 

1. Java is the toolset that will allow you to use VendorVault on your system. Hence, first you need to ensure that you have Java `17` or above installed on your Computer. If you are unsure, you can check by following the steps below:
   - 1a. Open up your command terminal. 
     * Windows users can open the terminal by typing in `Command Prompt` in the search bar located at the bottom left of the screen. 
     * Mac users can open the terminal by typing in `Terminal` using the spotlight search bar (accessed by pressing Command + Space). 
     * Linux users can open the command terminal by searching for `Terminal` or `Console` in the Applications Menu.
   
   - 1b. Type in `java -version` to check if you have Java installed. If you have Java installed you should see something like this: <br></br>
     ![Terminal Example showcasing java version](images/intro/terminalJavaVersion.png)
   
   - 1c. If you do not have Java installed or are currently on a different version, you can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17?er=221886).

2. Download the latest `vendorvault.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W14-1/tp/releases). <br></br>
   ![Download jar file](images/intro/jarFile.png) <br></br>

3. Upon downloading the `vendorvault.jar` file, copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your VendorVault Application.

4. Open the command terminal (same as step 1a), type `cd [path-to-your-folder]` (path to the folder you placed the jar file in step 3) and use the `java -jar vendorvault.jar` command in the terminal to run the application. <br></br>
   ![Starting up application](images/intro/startingApp.png) <br></br> If you encounter difficulties in this step, you may follow these guides below:
    * Windows users follow this [guide](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/change-directories-in-command-prompt/).
    * Mac users follow this [guide](https://darkroomphotos.com/mac-terminal-navigate-folders/).
    * Linux users follow this [guide](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/Linux-file-navigation-commands).


A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data:


![Ui](images/Ui.png)
<br>

5. In the application, the box that says **Enter command here ...** is called the command box. This is where you will input in your commands. 

6. The box below the command box is called the **results display box**. This is where the result of your inputted command will be displayed. 

7. You can type a command in the **command box** and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br></br> Some example commands you can try:

   * `list -a` : Lists all suppliers and deliveries.

   * `add -s n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com com/John street, block 123, #01-01 pro/iPhone` : Adds a supplier named `John Doe` to VendorVault.

   * `delete -d 3` : Deletes the 3rd delivery shown in the current delivery list.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

8. Refer to the [Features](#3-features) section below for details of each command.

# 3. Features

## 3.1. Understanding the Command Syntax

<box type="info" seamless>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parts of the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. the parameter `add n/NAME` can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Parameters **with** `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters **without** `…`​ after them can only be used once.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME` can only be used once.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* For the commands `help` `clear` and `exit`, extra information/words following the command after a space will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123 `, it will be interpreted as `exit`. However, `exit1` will not be recognized as a command.

* For all parameters, starting and ending spaces will be trimmed.

* For all commands except `find`, `sort` and `upcoming`, the displayed list of suppliers/deliveries will be the unfiltered and unsorted list of all suppliers/deliveries after executing the command.<br>
  For `find`, `sort` and `upcoming` commands, the displayed list will be the corresponding filtered/sorted list of supplier/deliveries. 

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## 3.5. Extended format guidelines

#### 3.5.1. Valid email address format

Valid email addresses are of the format: `local-part@domain`.  
Both `local-part` and `domain` must start and end with alphanumeric characters.  
Special characters cannot be used consecutively.

`local-part` must be alphanumeric, or these special characters: `+.-_`.

`domain` must be alphanumeric, or these special characters: `.-`.  
`domain` can be separated into multiple parts with `.`, and the last part must be at least 2 alphanumeric characters.
- Each part must start and end with alphanumeric characters.
- e.g. `example.com` is separated into two parts, `example` and `com`, and is a valid `domain`.

Valid email address examples:
- john.doe@example.com
- user123@my-website.com
- first.last@school.edu.sg

Invalid email address examples:
- john.@example.com (`local-part` (i.e. `john.`) cannot end in a `.`)
- john--doe@example.com (Special character `-` cannot be used consecutively)
- john.doe@example.c (Final `domain` part (i.e. `c`) must have at least 2 alphanumeric characters)

# 4. Managing your data

## 4.1. Saving the data

VendorVault data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.


## 4.2. Editing the data file

VendorVault automatically saves your data as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/vendorvault.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file. Find out how you can access the data file in the [FAQ section](#5-faq).

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Warnings:**
- **Backup before editing!** If the file is not edited correctly, VendorVault may not be able to read it which will cause all your data to be erased, and the app will start with an empty data file the next time you open it. <br>
- Furthermore, certain edits can cause VendorVault to behave in unexpected ways (e.g. if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>


## 4.3. Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

# 6. Known issues

1. **Using multiple screens**: if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the application window will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application and then run the application again.
2. **Running application in multiple windows simultaneously**: There will data synchronization issues. For example, if you add a new supplier named John Doe in one window, this change will not automatically reflect in other open windows. As a result, attempting to search for John Doe in a second window will not yield any results unless the application is restarted or refreshed. Avoid running multiple instances of the application at the same time to ensure consistent data access.
3. **Minimizing the Help Window**: If the Help Window is minimized, and you try to reopen it (using the help command, Help menu, or F1), it will continue to stay minimized. To fix this, you need to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
4. **App currently accepts certain invalid dates**: This is due to the automatic behavior of the `LocalDateTime` module, which adjusts certain invalid dates to the nearest valid date. We recommend checking the validity of dates manually before entering them. Improving these input checks to prevent invalid dates is a planned enhancement.
    - For example, If an invalid day is entered for the month, such as `31-04-2023` (April has 30 days), it is automatically adjusted to `30-04-2023`. For non-leap years, dates like `29-02-2023` are adjusted to `28-02-2023`. No error message is displayed for these invalid dates.
    - However, when entering any day greater than `31`, such as `33-05-2023`, an error message is displayed
