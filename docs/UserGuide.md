--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer (the Oracle version can be accessed [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-windows)).
For Mac users, please ensure you have this specific distribution, which can be installed by following this guide [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your BlitzBiz application.

4. Open a command terminal. This can be done by accessing the Terminal Application on Mac or Powershell on Windows.

5. Use the command `cd [DIRECTORY]` into the folder you put the jar file in.
For example, if the jar file was stored in the `Downloads` folder, the command will be as follows.
![CdCommand](images/QuickStartTerminalCdCommand.png)

6. Use the command `java -jar BlitzBiz.jar` to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

7. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the list of contacts in BlitzBiz.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

8. Refer to the [Commands Summary](#command-summary) below for a quick overview of all provided commands, their formats and some examples.

9. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are **optional**.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items in angular brackets means **at least one** of the items must be provided.<br>
  e.g. `<p/PHONE_NUMBER a/ADDRESS>` can be used as `p/91234567`, `a/My Street`, or `p/91234567 a/My Street`, but not ` ` (both arguments are missing). <br>

* Items together in curly square brackets means **one and only one** of them must be given as input.<br>
  e.g. `{n/NAME t/TAG}` can be used as `n/John Doe` or as `t/friends`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Each contact can have **at most one** social media handle
  * If multiple social media handles are provided in the `add` command, only the first in the order of (Carousell, Facebook, Instagram) will be added.
  * E.g. if a handle for Carousell, `cs/CAROUSELL_HANDLE`, and Instagram, `ig/INSTAGRAM_HANDLE`, was provided in this command, the handle for Carousell will be taken instead of the handle for Instagram.
* Adding a schedule is optional, but if a schedule is added, it **must** have a schedule date.

</div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**
You **cannot** edit schedule and social media information using the `edit` command.
Please use the [`schedule`](#scheduling-contacts--schedule) to edit schedule information and the [`socialMedia`](#adding-social-media--socialmedia) commands to edit social media information instead.

</div>

Examples:
* Edit the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively. <br>
`edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`
* Edit the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags. <br>
`edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/`

#### Adding Social Media : `socialMedia`

Adds or updates the social media handle to an existing person.
Perfect for contacts who keep changing their handles.

Format: `socialMedia INDEX <ig/USERNAME fb/USERNAME cs/USERNAME>`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the `socialMedia` command:**<br>

* `INDEX` refers to the number shown in the displayed person list, and is a positive integer, starting from 1. <br>
  View our [Viewing and Searching](#viewing-and-searching) section for more information.
* Contacts will have their social media handle displayed as `[ig-igusername]` or `[fb-fbusername]` or `[cs-csusername]`.
* `ig`,`fb`, and `cs` is used to represent Instagram, Facebook, and Carousell handles respectively.
* If the contact already has an existing social media handle, their handle will be updated.
* Hence, we can only add one social media handle to each contact.
* Handles must be non-empty, have a limit of 30 characters,and consist only of alphanumeric characters, or `-`, `_` and `.`.
* If multiple handles are entered, only the last handle will be accepted. <br>
  e.g., `socialMedia 1 ig/first cs/second` will only add the handle `[cs-second]` to the user.

</div>

Examples:
*  Updates the first contact Alex's social media to `[cs-alexsells]`. <br>
   `socialMedia 1 cs/alexsells` <br>
   ![result for 'rename tag2'](images/socialMediaResult2.png)

#### Scheduling Contacts : `schedule`

Have an appointment with a contact? Or are you expecting a delivery from a supplier?
Add a schedule to contact and give it a name based on your requirements!

Format: `schedule INDEX [sn/SCHEDULE_NAME] [sd/SCHEDULE_DATE] [st/SCHEDULE_TIME]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the `schedule` command:**<br>

* A schedule will only be valid if it has a `SCHEDULE_DATE`. `SCHEDULE_NAME` and `SCHEDULE_TIME` will not be displayed unless a schedule has a `SCHEDULE_DATE`.
* `INDEX` refers to the number shown in the displayed person list, and is a positive integer, starting from 1. <br>
  View our [Viewing and Searching](#viewing-and-searching) section for more information.
* If **all** the optional parameters are omitted and the contact has an existing schedule, the existing schedule will be **removed**.
* If the provided contact **does not have an existing schedule**, the `schedule` command **must** be provided with at least `SCHEDULE_DATE` to attach a schedule to the contact.
* If the provided contact **has an existing schedule**, the provided parameters will overwrite the existing schedule's parameters and keep the omitted parameters unchanged.
* `SCHEDULE_NAME` must strictly be alphanumerical.
* `SCHEDULE_DATE` must be in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`.
* `SCHEDULE_TIME` must be in the format `HH:mm`.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**

When performing the [`search`](#search-persons-by-schedule-range--search) command, contacts with an existing schedule,
but no `SCHEDULE_TIME` provided will have their schedule time's treated as `00:00`.

</div>

Examples:
* Schedules an appointment on 2024-10-22 at 16:00 for the contact at index 1 <br>
`schedule 1 sn/appointment sd/2024-10-22 st/16:00` <br>

`schedule 1` <br>
  ![result for clearing schedule](images/clearSchedule.png)

#### Renaming a Tag : `renameTag`

Renames all occurrences of an existing tag in the address book, if possible.
Great for changing the relationship of a group of contacts at one time!

Format: `renameTag ot/OLDTAG nt/NEWTAG`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the `renameTag` command:**<br>

* Renames the tags called `OLDTAG` to `NEWTAG`.
* Contacts with the tag `OLDTAG` will now have `NEWTAG`, with `OLDTAG` removed
* If `OLDTAG` is not an existing tag, `[OLDTAG] tag is not found` will be returned.
* If there are any contacts with both `[OLDTAG]` and `[NEWTAG]`, the `[OLDTAG]` will not be renamed as this will lead to duplicated tags.

</div>

Examples:
* Suppose we have a group of contacts with an existing tag `supplier`. We want to update all of these tags to `exSupplier`. <br>
`renameTag ot/supplier nt/exSupplier` <br>
![renameTag example](images/renameTagExample.png)


#### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

Format: `delete INDEX`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

</div>

  Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.

* `[ORDER]` can be either "asc" / "ascending" or "desc" / "descending" (case-insensitive).
* If no order is provided, persons will be sorted in ascending order by default.
* Contact list will be sorted alphabetically by name with `n/` and by schedule with `sch/`.
* If the list is filtered/searched before executing the sort command, it will display the sorted filter/search list.
* Executing the `list` function after will show the sorted full list.
* When sorting by schedules:
    1. Contacts with no schedules will appear at the end of the list.
    2. Contacts with a date but no time as schedule will be sorted under the assumption that their time is 00:00.

</div>

Examples:
* Sort by persons names alphabetically in ascending order <br>
  `sort n/`

### Data Management

#### Saving the data

BlitzBiz data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### Editing the data file

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, BlitzBiz will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to make a backup of the file using the backup command  before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the app to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

We strongly recommend that newer users or users unfamiliar with JSON file formats **do not** manually edit the data files. 
</div>

BlitzBiz data is saved automatically as a JSON file (a type of file that organises and stores data) `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data
directly by editing that data file.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: To safely transfer your data, install the app in the other computer. Use the `backup` command on your original computer and transfer the `addressbook.json` file at `[JAR file location]/backup`
to `[JAR file location]/data` in your new computer.

**Q**: What should I do if I cannot start up the application?<br>
**A**: We advise you to download the latest release of our app [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/releases).<br>
Note that the contacts saved in the previous application needs to be manually transferred to this new application.
For instructions on how to transfer data, please view the FAQ about `How do I transfer my data to another computer?` above.

**Q**: I have manually updated the data file to add more contacts. However, after starting up the application, I do not see any contacts. What should I do?<br>
**A**: We advise users to view the warnings listed under [Editing the data file](#editing-the-data-file).
Users are advised to ensure that all fields of each contact are compliant with the corresponding constraints.
Please refer to the [Arguments Constraints Summary](#argument-constraints-summary) table for more details.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
