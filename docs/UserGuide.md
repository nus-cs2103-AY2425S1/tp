TAHub is a **desktop app for managing students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, TAHub can get your student management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

TAHub simplifies the role of Teaching Assistants by providing a centralized hub to organize student information, and efficiently manage course-related tasks. This platform empowers TAs to focus more on enhancing student learning and less on administrative chaos.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
To check your Computer's Java Version, see this [guide](https://www.wikihow.com/Check-Your-Java-Version-in-the-Windows-Command-Line).<br>
If you don't have Java, see this installation [guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/install/overview-jdk-installation.html).<br>


2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-1/tp/releases).<br>
  Scroll down until you see this part. Click on `tahub.jar` to download it.
  ![img](images/UgQuickStartDownload.png)


3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TAHub.<br>
  The _home folder_ is where other files such as the data file will be created.


4. Open a command terminal and `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in.<br>
   If you don't know what that means, fret not - see [here](https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Directories-in-Command-Prompt).


5. Type `java -jar tahub.jar` and hit enter.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds.<br>
   Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>


   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)


6. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com c/CS2103T;CS2101` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to TAHub.

   * `delete 2` : Deletes the 2nd student shown in the current student list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all students, consultations & lessons.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.


7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**How do I read the command format?**<br>

* Main command keywords are **case-sensitive** unless specified otherwise.<br>
  e.g. `Find` and `Add` do not work for `find` and `add` respectively.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [c/COURSE]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/CS2103T` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[c/COURSE]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `c/CS2103T;CS2101` 
(note that use of `;` is unique to only some fields), `c/CS2103T c/CS2101` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `liststudents`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

**Additional Notes**

Here are more detailed notes regarding certain parameters that apply to all commands unless specified otherwise.

* When specifying an index, leading zeroes are ignored, i.e. `001` is equivalent to `1`.

* When specifying an index, it should be between 1 and 2147483647, inclusive. The current error message
may not reflect this requirement, but changes for clarification are planned in the future.

* When targeting a student by their index, TAHub uses the indexes **as currently displayed** on the
student list. For example, if you run a `find` command that only lists one student out of originally five, trying
to select a student at index 2 will fail.

* Can search for names and courses. Use the `n/` prefix to search for names and the `c/` prefix to search for courses.
* Partial searches will be matched e.g. `Jam` will match `James` and `James Ho`
* Each sequence of words not separated by `;` or a prefix will be used as a search. This means that `jam ho` will not match `James Ho`
* If a semicolon was used to separate searches, students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). 
* If a prefix was used to separate searches, students matching all keywords will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).
* If no names are provided to the find command (i.e. `find n/`), all students will be listed.

## Storage Operations

### Saving the data

TAHub data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

TAHub data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TAHub will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TAHub to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

It is highly recommended to make a copy of the date file before editing it.
However, Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. Occasionally, **the consults and lessons list** may not display properly, i.e. have wrong heights. Try using the relevant list command `listconsults` or `listlessons` to refresh the list. Alternatively, try scrolling the list with a mouse. This should update the display to remedy the bug.
4. Certain characters cannot be used in student names, such as `/` or `-`, which prevent legitimate parts of names such as `S/O` from being input. This will be addressed in a future version.
