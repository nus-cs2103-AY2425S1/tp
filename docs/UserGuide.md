## Introduction
VolunTier is a **top _Tier_** solution for volunteer organizations specializing in teaching students and managing a growing clientele efficiently. 
Designed for those **comfortable with the Command Line Interface (CLI) and quick typing**,

## Quick start

### Installation of application

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F08-1a/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your VolunTier app.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar VolunTier.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

* `list` : Lists all contacts.

* `addTutor \n John Doe \p 98765432 \e johndoe@example.com \a 311, Clementi Ave 2, 123456 \h 6 ` : Adds a tutor named `John Doe` with the phone number `98765432`, email `johndoe@example.com`, residing at `311, Clementi Ave 2, 123456`, and records `6` hours of tutoring.

* `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

* `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

* `exit` : Exits the app.

7. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

### CLI tutorial

Skip to [Features](#features) if you are proficient in CLI.

This tutorial introduces you to the basics of using the Command Line Interface (CLI) on Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS) and Windows. By the end, you’ll be comfortable navigating the file system, managing files, and running basic commands through the terminal.

#### 1. **What is the CLI?**
The CLI is a text-based interface where users interact with the operating system by typing commands. It allows for:
- **Efficient operations** compared to GUI
- **Advanced automation** with scripts and batch commands

#### 2. **Opening the Terminal**

##### On macOS:
Type `Terminal` in Spotlight Search (`F4` or `Cmd + Space`)

##### On Windows:
Search for command prompt or Powershell in the start menu.

##### On Linux:
```shell
Ctrl + Alt + T
```
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### User Interface

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addTutor \n NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addTutor \n John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `\n NAME [\h HOURS]` can be used as `\n John Doe \h 10` or as `\n John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[\s SUBJECT]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `\s English`, `\s English \s Math` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `\n NAME \p PHONE_NUMBER`, `\p PHONE_NUMBER \n NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `undo`, `redo`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.<br>
  Index **must be a positive integer**.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* Users who have used VolunTier before can jump to [Command Summary](#command-summary)

Format: `import \f FILEPATH`

* Use this to import your current users from your Excel spreadsheets to VolunTier.
* The .csv file to be imported must have these headings in this order: “name”, “phone”, “email”, “address”, “hours”, “role” and “subjects”.
* There should be no empty rows in your CSV file.
* For optional fields like hours and subject, leave a blank.<br>
  For example, the following row leaves hours and subject blank: John, 91234567, john@gmail.com, “1 Jurong, 123456”, , Tutor,
* For any field that requires a comma, surround it in quotes like this: "1 Jurong, 123456".
* For more than one subject, separate it with a semicolon like this: English; Science.


Example:
*  `import \f ./data/new_persons.csv` imports a list of people in new_persons.csv located in ./data/ into VolunTier.
* Output: `5 persons added. Rows with duplicates: [2, 4]. The following rows had data which failed some constraints: Row 3: Invalid email format. Row 5: Missing phone number.`

<box type="info" seamless>

Import only works for a list of persons. It does not support the lessons feature.

### Exiting the program : `exit`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Saving the data

VolunTier data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

VolunTier data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, VolunTier will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the VolunTier to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: Can I customize the subjects offered in VolunTier?<br>
**A**: Currently, VolunTier supports only three basic subjects: Math, Science, and English. Custom subjects are not supported, but this feature may be considered in future updates.

**Q**: Is it possible to export my data from VolunTier?<br>
**A**: VolunTier currently does not support an export feature directly. However, you can manually copy the addressbook.json file from the data folder and use it as a backup or to transfer data to another instance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Viewing Tutor Chart when tutor's name is very long** will cause layout issues and make the chart difficult to interpret. We are aware of this issue and plan to address it in future implementations to improve readability and user experience. As the average Singaporean would not have such long names, the remedy for now is to keep their names short by abbreviation.
