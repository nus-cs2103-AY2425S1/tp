   Here are some examples of commands you can try:

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 g/male m/Physics` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to StoreClass.

   * `list` : Lists all students and their details.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list of students.

   * `clear` : Deletes all students.

   * `exit` : Exits the program.
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for a more detailed overview of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Before you read on, here are some important notes about the command format that you need to know:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `...`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `m/MODULE...​` can be used as `m/Mathematics`, `m/Biology m/Physics` etc.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/paid_tuition`, `t/paid_tuition t/smart` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order unless specified.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines, as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Viewing help : `help`

You can view the help page using this command.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a student: `add`

You can add a student to StoreClass using this command.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE g/GENDER m/MODULE... [t/TAG]…​`

* `n/NAME` : The full name of the student to be added.
* `p/PHONE` : The phone number of the student to be added.
* `g/GENDER` : The gender of the student to be added.
* `m/MODULE` : The module that the student is taking.
* `t/TAG` : The tag of the student.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: **Here are the field constraints that you should be aware of**

- Names should only contain alphabets, hyphens, dots, commas, forward slash and spaces, and be between 1 and 100 characters long. Although / is allowed in names, you should use it carefully, input like m/ g/ n/ will still be recognised as prefix and may lead to unexpected behaviour.

- Phone numbers should only contain numbers, and be exactly 8 digits long. This is because StoreClass is specifically targeting private education institutions in Singapore.

- Gender should be either `male` or `female`, and is case-sensitive.

- Module should consist of alphanumeric characters and spaces only, and it should be between 1 and 30 characters long.

- Tag should consist of alphanumeric characters only, and it should be between 1 and 30 characters long.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:warning: **Caution:**
- Students with same name, regardless of case-sensitivity, will be considered as the same student and will not be added.
- Modules and tags are case-sensitive and will be added as they are.
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 g/male m/Mathematics` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to StoreClass.
* `add n/Betsy Crowe g/female p/12345678 m/Physics m/Chemistry t/OLevels t/new` : Adds a student named `Betsy Crowe` to StoreClass.


### Listing all students : `list`

You can show a list of all students in StoreClass.

Format: `list`

### Editing a student : `edit`

You can edit an existing student in StoreClass.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [g/GENDER] [m/MODULE]… [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* Similarly, when editing modules, the existing modules of the person will be removed i.e adding of modules is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:warning: **Caution:**
Editing modules will cause grades to disappear.
</div>

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567` : Edits the phone number of the 1st person to be `91234567`.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` : Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Locating students by name: `find`

You can find students whose names or tags contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]…`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name and tags are searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Students matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:

* `find alex` returns `Alex Yeoh` _(search by name)_
* `find colleague` returns `Bernice Yu` and `Roy Balakrishnan` _(search by tag)_
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li` _(search by multiple parameters)_ <br> 

![result for 'find alex david'](images/findResult.png)

### Filter students : `filter`

You can filter students who meet all specified conditions.

Format: `filter [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [g/GENDER] [t/TAG]… [m/MODULE]…`
* The filter is case-insensitive. eg `hans` will match `Hans`.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`, same to all parameter.
* Filtering by `grade` is not supported.
* Students matching all the given conditions will be returned (i.e. `AND` search).
* Filters with empty tag will return all students.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**

 - Each parameter can only contain one keyword.
 - This command works separately from the find command, e.g. you cannot execute a find command on a filtered list, and vice versa.
 - Both filter and find **cannot** be chained, they will filter and find based on the entire student list every time you execute them.
</div>

Examples:
* `filter n/alex` : returns `Alex Yeoh` _(filter by name)_
* `filter g/male t/new` : returns `James Li`, `Roy Balakrishnan` and `Linus Koo`. _(filter by gender and tag)_
* `filter g/male t/new t/OLevels` : returns `David Li` _(filter by gender and multiple tags)_
* `filter g/female t/IB m/Physics` : return `Bernice Yu` _(filter by multiple conditions)_

### Deleting a student : `delete`

You can delete a specified student from StoreClass.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the student at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

### Undoing the last action: `undo`

The `undo` command allows you to reverse the last action performed, helping you recover any data that may have been unintentionally deleted or modified.

**Format:** `undo`

#### How it works:
- When you perform an action that modifies the address book (like adding, editing, or deleting an entry), that action is saved in memory.
- By executing `undo`, the most recent modification is reverted, and the address book is restored to its previous state.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tips:** for Efficient Usage <br>

1. **Use Undo After a Mistake**: If you accidentally delete or modify a contact, you can quickly use `undo` to revert the last action and restore the previous state. <br>
2. **Undo Works Only for Modifying Commands**: Only actions that modify the address book (like `add`, `edit`, or `delete`) can be undone. Commands like `list`, `filter`, or `find` do not trigger the undo mechanism. The reasoning behind this is that we consider them as view commands, not action commands that alter student data.
3. **Undo Resets to Full View**: After using `undo`, the program will display all students in the address book, letting you confirm that your last change has been successfully reverted.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-secondary">
:question: **Common Question:**
Why does `undo` not work after I run `list`, `filter`, or `find`? <br>
`undo` only works for actions that modify the address book. Since `list`, `filter`, or `find` do not modify the data, they do not impact the undo history.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:warning: **Caution:**
Executing a command that modifies the address book (like `add`, `edit`, or `delete`) will **clear the redo stack**. This means once you undo an action and perform another modification, you cannot redo the previous undone action.
</div>

#### Example Scenario:
1. You delete a contact.
    - *Before Delete:* [Initial State]
    - *After Delete:* [After Delete Command]
2. You decide to undo the delete action.
    - *After Undo:* [After Undo Command] – The deleted contact is restored.

**[Initial State]**
<br>

<br>
<img src="images/UndoRedoExample2.png" alt="After Delete Command" />

**[After Undo Command]**
<br>
<img src="images/UndoRedoExample3.png" alt="After Undo Command" />

Examples:
* `undo` will revert the last command executed, restoring the previous state of the address book.

### Redoing the Last Undone Action: `redo`

The `redo` command allows you to reapply the last action that was undone, restoring the previous state of the address book. This can be useful if you change your mind after undoing an action.

**Format:** `redo`

- **Note:** Like `undo`, the `redo` command cannot be used with commands like `list`, `filter`, or `find`.

#### How it works:
- If you’ve used `undo` to reverse an action, the `redo` command will restore that action, essentially “re-doing” it.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tips:** for Efficient Usage <br>

1. **Use Redo to Restore Actions**: If you’ve undone an action by mistake, `redo` lets you reapply the change quickly. It’s useful when you second-guess your decision.
2. **Redo Works Only After Undo**: `redo` will only work if an action has been undone previously. If you haven’t undone an action, `redo` will not perform anything.
3. **Redo Resets to Full View**: After using `redo`, the program will show all students in the address book, allowing you to verify that your last action has been reapplied successfully.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-secondary">
:question: **Common Question:**
Why does `redo` not work after I’ve made new changes to the address book? <br>
`redo` only works if there is a previous action that was undone. If a new action is performed after an undo, the redo history is cleared, and there is nothing to redo.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:warning: **Caution:**
Executing a command that modifies the address book (like `add`, `edit`, or `delete`) will **clear the redo stack**. This means once you undo a change and then modify the address book again, you will lose the ability to redo the previous undone action.
</div>

#### Example Scenario (Continuation from Undo):
1. You undo a deletion of a contact.
    - *After Undo:* [After Undo Command] – The deleted contact is restored.
2. You decide to redo the action and delete the contact again.
    - *After Redo:* [After Redo Command] – The contact is deleted once more.

### Grading a Module: `grade`

You can assign a grade to a module that a student is taking.

**Format:** `grade INDEX m/MODULE s/GRADE`

- Assigns a numerical grade (between 0 and 100) to the module identified by the `INDEX` number shown in the displayed person list.
- `INDEX`: The index number of the student in the displayed person list (must be a positive integer).
- `m/MODULE`: The module code to which the grade is assigned. The module match is case-sensitive.
- `s/GRADE`: The numerical grade (between 0 and 100) to assign to the module.
- You can provide multiple `m/MODULE s/GRADE` pairs to assign grades to multiple modules in a single `grade` command. 
- The `m/MODULE s/GRADE` pairs need not to be in order, see examples for illustration.
- The grade can be any whole number between 0 and 100, inclusive.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: **Important Note:**

- Each module specified in the `grade` command must be a module that the student is taking.
- The number of `m/MODULE` prefixes must match the number of `s/GRADE` prefixes.
- Grades are assigned to modules based on the order of the `m/MODULE s/GRADE` pairs provided in the command.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-primary">
<img class="emoji" title=":bulb:" alt=":bulb:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f4a1.png" height="20" width="20"> <strong>Tip:</strong>
You can hover over each individual module for a while to view the grades for that module.
</div>

**Examples:**
- `grade 1 m/Physics s/85` : assigns a grade of 85 to Physics for the first student.
- `grade 2 m/Chemistry s/90` : assigns a grade of 90 to Chemistry for the second student.
- `grade 3 m/English s/80 m/Chinese s/85` assigns a grade of 80 to English and 85 to Chinese for the third student.
- `grade 1 m/Math m/Chinese s/100 s/90` will grade the first person's Math to 100 and his Chinese to 90.


### Archiving data files: `archive`

You can archive the current address book to a specific file name.

After archiving, you can find the archived file in the folder `archived` with the name `FILENAME` in the home folder that you've chosen to put the `jar` file of StoreClass in.

Format: `archive pa/FILENAME`

Example: `archive pa/mybook.json`

The file name must end with ".json" and must not contain any slashes "/".

There should be only one file name provided.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:rotating_light: **Warning:**
When you execute the archive command, all entries in the current StoreClass will be discarded.

If you choose an existing archive file as the file name when archiving, the old archive file will be overwritten.
</div>

### Load data files: `load`

You can load data from an archived file into StoreClass.

You can only load from files under the folder named `archived`. This folder is located in the home folder that you've chosen to put the `jar` file of StoreClass in.

Format: `load pa/FILENAME`

Example: `load pa/mybook.json`

The file name must end with ".json", must not contain any slashes "/" and must point to an existing StoreClass .json file.

There should be only one file name provided.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:rotating_light: **Warning:**
It is recommended that you avoid loading non-StoreClass .json files, as it may result in unexpected behaviors

When you execute the load command, all the entries in the current StoreClass will be overwritten. So, it is recommended that you archive the current data in StoreClass before loading.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-secondary">
:question: **Common Question:**
What happens to the undo/redo stack after archiving or loading the address book? <br>
When you call `archive` or `load`, the undo/redo history is cleared to prevent inconsistencies between the address book data and the stored history. Always ensure the current state is saved before performing these actions.
</div>

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

You can all the current entries in StoreClass with this command.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

You can exit the program with this command.

Format: `exit`

### Autocomplete

The Autocomplete feature provides real-time command suggestions as you type, helping you quickly and accurately enter commands. Autocomplete identifies keywords and suggests matches, allowing you to streamline input by selecting from relevant options instead of typing full commands or field values.

#### How It Works
Autocomplete operates based on the word at your current caret position:

* As you begin typing a command or field, suggestions will appear that match the word under your current caret position. For example, typing `ad` will display a list of commands beginning with `ad`, like `add`. 
  * Autocomplete matches with the text characters before your caret position of the word under your current caret position. For example, when typing in the command keyword `ad` and you move your cursor between `a` and `d`, Autocomplete will show you all commands starting with `a`. You can utilize this to do some cool tricks as explained in the tips section below.
* Autocomplete for command keywords e.g. `clear`, `delete`, `add` applies only to the first word you type in the command box. This initial word is treated as the command.
* Autocomplete for student fields applies to all subsequent words after the first word. All subsequent words after the first are treated as student fields with specific prefixes, e.g. `m/Math`, `g/male`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: **Note:** Autocomplete will **not** match subsequent words after the first word you entered with command keywords! Similarly, Autocomplete will **not** match the first word you entered with student fields! </div>

#### Supported Commands
Autocomplete supports all existing command keywords when matching.

#### Supported Fields
Autocomplete currently supports the following fields with these prefixes:

| Prefix   | Field            | Description                                     |
|----------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `m/`     | Modules          | Matches **all existing** module names           |
| `t/`     | Tags             | Matches **all existing** tags                   |
| `g/`     | Gender           | Matches gender values: `male` or `female`       |
| `pa/`    | File Paths       | Matches **all existing** archived file paths    |

When these prefixes are detected, Autocomplete automatically displays a list of suggestions related to these fields. The list of suggestions are generated through the existing list of students inside StoreClass.

#### Example Usage
If you begin typing `edit 1 m/M`, Autocomplete will provide suggestions for available modules starting with the letter `M`, helping you to quickly select the correct module name. Similarly, typing `t/` after the command will bring up a list of tags, allowing you to specify tags accurately without needing to remember or retype exact names.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: **Note:** Autocomplete is **case-insensitive**! </div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-secondary">
:question: **Common Question:**
Why are there no suggestions when I type in `m/`, `t/` or `pa/`? <br>
Autocomplete searches for suggestions relevant to these fields based on the existing data in StoreClass. If there are no data or students inside StoreClass, then no suggestions will be 
generated for these fields. This usually occurs after a `clear` command.
</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tips:** for Efficient Usage <br>

1. **Start with the command**: Autocomplete only activates for commands when typing the first word. <br>
2. **Remember to use prefixes**: For fields, make sure to use the correct prefix (`m/`, `t/`, `g/`, `pa/`) to activate Autocomplete for those fields. <br>
3. **Select from suggestions using arrow keys**: Save time by selecting from the suggestion list using arrow keys rather than typing full names or values.<br>
4. **Typos**: When you accidentally type in the wrong name for an existing field, instead of holding backspace and retyping the entire field, simply move the caret position over to the 
prefix, and select from the list of suggestions. Autocomplete will replace the entire field with your selection for you.
</div>

By utilizing Autocomplete, you can input commands more quickly, reduce typos, and improve your overall efficiency in navigating the software!

![Autocomplete example when keying in gender](images/AutocompleteExample.png)

### Saving the data

StoreClass data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command you enter that changes the data. There is no need to save manually!

### Editing the data file

StoreClass data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:rotating_light: **Warning:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, StoreClass will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the StoreClass to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous StoreClass home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **After inputting a command**, the scroll bar in the command box becomes unresponsive. The remedy is to click on the scroll bar to make it responsive again.
4. **When the UI window is set to a small size** certain element in the UI maybe hard to view. E.g. modules, long names... Hence, we recommend you to use a large screen and a large window size when using our product so that all the fields can be viewed clearly.
