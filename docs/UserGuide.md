## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times, but with a limit of 2 tags. Each tag can have a maximum of 9 characters. <br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## Additional Features

### Command history: Up and Down arrow keys
NUStates keeps a history of the commands you have entered. You can navigate through this history using the up and down arrow keys.

<box type="note" seamless>

- **Down Arrow Key**: Pressing the down arrow key will cycle forward through the command history, allowing you to revisit commands you have skipped over.

This feature is particularly useful for quickly re-executing previous commands without having to retype them.

Examples:
1. After entering several commands, press the **up arrow key** to view the last command you entered.
2. Continue pressing the **up arrow key** to cycle through older commands.
3. If you go too far back, press the **down arrow key** to move forward in the command history.

### Highlighting of command errors

NUStates will highlight any specific errors in the command entered by the user. This feature helps users quickly identify and correct any mistakes in their commands.

### Saving the data

AddressBook data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

NUStates data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
- If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, NUStates might fail to run, or discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
- Certain edits can cause NUStates to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
- If all the data files are corrupted and there is no way of retrieving the original file made before the edit, delete the data file and restart NUStates. NUStates will reinitialise and run with the default data loaded.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window. 
3. Two people are permitted to have the **same phone number, email address and address**.
4. **If you have a tag containing invalid characters**, only the first tag that appears in the command will be highlighted as error.
