### Introduction


TalentSG is a desktop application designed for HR professionals and recruiters who need to efficiently manage candidates and job roles. Built with productivity in mind, TalentSG is optimised for those who prefer a Command Line Interface (CLI) experience while still benefiting from a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This combination allows users to perform tasks through concise, text-based commands and receive visual feedback for each command executed.

TalentSG streamlines the process of tracking candidates, organizing job roles, and filtering based on status or skillsets. With a flexible command structure, users can work intuitively without having to remember overly complex commands, making TalentSG both powerful and user-friendly.

If youâ€™re a fast typist, TalentSG can significantly speed up your candidate management workflow compared to traditional GUI-only applications. It is especially useful for those who value precision and speed, as the CLI minimises the clicks and steps required to complete various HR tasks.

This document provides an in-depth guide to using TalentSGâ€™s features and commands, ensuring that users can maximise their experience with the app. We currently support both Windows and Mac operating systems, so feel free to jump to [Quick Start](#quick-start) to begin.

We hope TalentSG becomes an indispensable tool in your recruitment and candidate management journey!

This app is a desktop app for managing candidates and job roles, **optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, this app can help you manage your candidates and job roles faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Overview of TalentSG Graphical User Interface

<img src="images/UiDetailsImg.png" width="800">

TalentSGâ€™s UI has five main components:

1. **Applicants List**: Contains the list of the applicants.

2. **Overview Panel**: Contains details about the applicants. It can be their full detail or the summary of all the applicants.

3. **Command Input Box**: Enter the commands here for the input.

4. **Feedback/Result Display**: Shows the result of the command when executed or the feedback if thereâ€™s some error.

5. **Menu Bar**: It has two menus:

    a. File which consists of Close and Summary.

    b. Help which consists of Help and Bug Report.

<strong>[Note]</strong>: The application utilizes a fixed-size user interface to ensure a consistent and predictable layout across all devices. 
This approach provides precise control over design elements, maintaining the intended aesthetic and usability without the need for resizing, 
optimized for the target screen resolution. This design choice simplifies user interaction and reduces potential compatibility issues, supporting
 a streamlined and focused workflow.

## Features

TalentSG provides a variety of features to help you manage candidates and job roles effectively.

### Notes About the Command Format

- **UPPER_CASE**: Parameters to be supplied by the user.
    - E.g., in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` can be `John Doe`.
- **[Square Brackets]**: Optional items.
    - E.g., `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be `n/John Doe t/friend` or `n/John Doe`.
- **Ellipsis (...)**: Items that can be used multiple times, including zero times.
    - E.g., `[t/TAG]...` can be `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family`, or omitted entirely.
- **Parameters Order**: Parameters can be in any order.
    - E.g., `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` is the same as `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME`.
- **Extraneous Parameters**: Ignored for commands that do not take parameters such as `Summary`, `List`, `Help`, `Clear` & `Exit`.
    - E.g., `help 123` is interpreted as `help`.
- **Copying Commands**: Be cautious when copying multi-line commands from PDFs; line breaks may affect the command execution.

- <strong>[Note]</strong>: The **Name** field:
<br>1. Accepts a large number of characters (over 50), but excessively long names may be truncated in the display for better readability.
<br>2. Accepts numerical values. There are laws around the world which allow people to have numerical values as names. You can read more about this from this [article](https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-name-rules).
<br>3. Does not accept special characters (e.g., `/`, `-`). This restriction may pose limitations for certain names, such as `s/o` or hyphenated names. A workaround is to use spaces or omit these characters (e.g., enter `John s o Kaarthik` instead of `John s/o Kaarthik`).

- <strong>[Note]</strong>: The **Note** field is recommended to be within 200 characters for optimal performance and display. Exceeding this length may result in truncated display or other limitations in certain views.


> **General Note**: The fields in TalentSG only support alphanumeric characters, spaces, and a few select symbols like `#` and `:` in specific cases. If a field requires a symbol that is unsupported (e.g., `/`, `-`, `@`), you may consider using an alternative format or omitting the symbol entirely. For example:
> - Use `Objective C` instead of `Objective-C`.
> - Use `John s o Kaarthik` instead of `John s/o Kaarthik`.
> - Use `Apartment No 3` instead of `Apartment #3`.

- <strong>[Caution]</strong>: Extremely long names may be truncated in both the **Applicants list** and **Overview Panel** due to space constraints. If you need to view the full name, you may access the data file directly. To ensure readability, it is recommended to keep names within a reasonable length.

- <strong>[Caution]</strong>: The required information except tags cannot be empty.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: Help! Double-clicking TalentSG.jar does not launch the application - what should I do?<br>
**A**: Try running the application from the command line using the following command: `java -jar TalentSg.jar`. Windows users can use the Command Prompt application to do this while Mac users can use the Terminal application.

For this problem, we suggest that you try to maximise the application from the task manager or try to split the screen with another application so that TalentSG will resize back to normal. If the mentioned solutions fail, please do download TalentSg again!

**Q**: How do I save my data?<br>
