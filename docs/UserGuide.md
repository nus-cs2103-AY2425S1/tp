## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [c/CLIENT_TYPE]` can be used as `n/John Doe c/Plan A` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items that are **not** in square brackets are compulsory and must not be empty.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME` must be used as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[c/CLIENT_TYPE]…​` can be used as ` `, `c/Plan A`, `c/Plan A c/Plan B` etc. (i.e. 0 or more times, since it is a optional field) <br>
  e.g. `c/CLIENT_TYPE…​`can be used as `c/Plan A`, `c/Plan A c/Plan B` etc. (i.e. 1 or more times, since it is compulsory)

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Add `$` after the input name to indicate **exact** name.<br>
  * This is useful when a client's name is a prefix of another client's name.
  * Order of name inputs matter when using `$`
  * Name written before `$` must be **EXACT** name of the client.


  e.g. `delete John Doe$` will delete the client with the name `John Doe`.<br>
  e.g. If there are two client named `David Li` and `David Lim`, typing `delete David Li$` will delete the client with the name `David Li`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `sort` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

#### Note
* `NAME` is **case-insensitive**. The first letter of every word will be automatically converted to capital letter and the rest to small letters. This is
to ensure that 2 names with the same letters but different cases are not considered as different names. 

    e.g. `john doe` and `John Doe` are considered the same name and cannot be added as 2 different clients.

* `CLIENT_TYPE` is **case-sensitive**. This is to give greater flexibility to differentiate between different client types that are similar but have different cases.

    e.g. `Health` is different from `hEaLtH` while `Investment` and `Investment` are the same and are considered duplicates

* **"Do not exist"** inputs for `DATETIME`: 
  * If specified datetime is **valid** (i.e. dd = 01 to 31) but **does not exist** in that month, the reminder will be updated to the **NEAREST VALID** `DATETIME`
      * E.g. If `DateTime` is made to be `2024-02-30 16:00` which does not exist, the reminder will be added with dt:`2024-02-29 16:00`

Examples:
* `view John Doe` shows the client named `John Doe`
* `view John` will throw an error if there is `John Doe` and `John Doey` in the list of clients

## Additional Features
### Command History Navigation
The command history feature allows users to easily navigate through previously entered commands using the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys. This is helpful for quickly accessing past commands without needing to retype them.

* **Up** Arrow: Moves to the previous command in the history.
* **Down** Arrow: Moves to the next command in the history.

This feature enables efficient command recall, streamlining the process of repeating or editing previous inputs.

### Saving the data

ClientHub data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes
the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

ClientHub data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/clienthub.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ClientHub will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the ClientHub to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ClientHub home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **If you view a client that already has an existing view pop-up**, a duplicate view pow-up window will be shown. This is a feature that is allowed in the application. The remedy is to close the duplicate view pop-up window manually.
4. **If you input more than 300 characters for name, email or address**, the view pop-up will not be able to display the full name, email or address. The remedy is to input less than 300 characters for name, email or address.
