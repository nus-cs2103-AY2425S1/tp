# DorManagerPro User Guide

DorManagerPro (DMP) is a desktop app tailored for **university dorm managers who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)**,
designed to allow easy and efficient management of dormitory resident details within an address book.

Created for busy university dorm managers looking to increase their efficiency, DorManagerPro provides unique features to streamline
the process of accessing and updating resident student details. What's more, DorManagerPro is extremely simple to use; we only require our users to know how to type.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer. Its installer can be downloaded [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) if you do not have it.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-4/tp/releases/).

3. Locate the `.jar` file in your computer. Typically, this will be in the `Downloads` folder.
> <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen"> TIP! </span> <br>
>
> You may wish to copy the `.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for DorManagerPro. All the files needed to run DorManagerPro will be created within the home folder.

4. Open up a command terminal, navigate to the home folder of DorManagerPro with the [`cd` command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=directories-changing-another-directory-cd-command)
   and type `java -jar DorManagerPro.jar` to run the application. After a few seconds, you should see the following window appear.<br>
   <img src="images/TemplateUi.png" alt="Ui screenshot" height=auto width="850"/>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/+65 98765432 e/johnd@example.com r/01-1008 a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the DorManagerPro address book.

   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
>
> **Some notes about the command format:**<br>
>
>* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
>  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
>
>* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
>  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
>
>* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
>  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
>
>* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
>  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.
>
>* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `undo`, `clean` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
>  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
>
>* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Viewing help : `help`

Format: `help`

A help window will pop up containing basic introduction to the three core features `add`, `edit` and `delete`.

<img src="images/helpMessage.png" alt="Help Message" height=auto width="850"/>

### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL [r/ROOM_NUMBER] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]...`

> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
>
> * `ROOM_NUMBER`, `ADDRESS` AND `TAG` are optional.
> * A person can have up to 10 tags (including 0).
> * `NAME` consists of alphabets, numbers, dashes (-), commas (,) and apostrophes (').
> * `PHONE` consists of an optional country code indicated with a plus (+), an optional area code and a compulsory number.
> * `EMAIL` should be of the format local-part@domain.

> <span style="color:Tomato"> WARNING! </span> <br>
>
> * If there are duplicate names, i.e if a person in the DorManagerPro address book already has the specified `NAME`, an error will be thrown. This is because it is very rare for two people to have the exact same name down to the surname. Instead, we allow numerals to denote different people with the same name.
> * If there are duplicate phone numbers, i.e if a person in the DorManagerPro address book already has the specified `PHONE`, an error will be thrown. This is because no two people have the same phone number.
> * If there are duplicate emails, i.e if a person in the DorManagerPro address book already has the specified `EMAIL`, an error will be thrown. This is because no two people have the same email address.



Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/+123 98765432 e/johnd@example.com r/01-0110 a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/Resident Assistant e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Street p/1234567 t/Floor 1`

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [r/ROOM_NUMBER] [a/ADDRESS] [en/EMERGENCY_NAME] [ep/EMERGENCY_PHONE] [g/GRADUATION_YEAR] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* Once `ADDRESS`, `ROOM_NUMBER`, `EMERGENCY_NAME`, `EMERGENCY_PHONE`, and/or `GRADUATION_YEAR` has been specified, you cannot remove these fields.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all of a person’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
>
> * The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
> * A person can have up to 10 tags (including 0).
> * `NAME` and `EMERGENCY_NAME` consist of alphabets, numbers, dashes (-), commas (-), and apostrophes (').

> * `GRADUATION_YEAR` should be of the format `2YYY`.
> * Refer to [Field constraints](#field-constraints) for more details on accepted values for each field.


> <span style="color:Tomato"> WARNING! </span> <br>
>
> * If there are duplicate names, i.e if a person in the DorManagerPro address book already has the specified `NAME`, an error will be thrown. This is because it is very rare for two people to have the exact same name down to the surname. Instead, we allow numerals to denote different people with the same name.
> * If there are duplicate phone numbers, i.e if a person in the DorManagerPro address book already has the specified `PHONE`, an error will be thrown. This is because no two people have the same phone number.
> * If there are duplicate emails, i.e if a person in the DorManagerPro address book already has the specified `EMAIL`, an error will be thrown. This is because no two people have the same email address.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 en/Betsy Crower ep/+65 91235678 t/` edits the name and phone number of the emergency contact of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and `+65 91235678` respectively, and clears all existing tags.

The following screenshot shows the results of executing `edit 2 en/Betsy Crower p/+65 91235678 t/`.

<img src="images/EditCommandExampleUsage.png" alt="EditCommand screenshot" height=auto width="850"/>

### Finding a person: `find`

Format: `find [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [r/ROOM_NUMBER] [t/TAG]…​`

> <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen"> TIP! </span> <br>
> All possible orders and combinations of the 4 parameters `NAME`, `PHONE`, `ROOM_NUMBER` and `TAG` are accepted.

> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
>
> * The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`.
> * The order of the keywords when searching for `NAME` does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
> * Only full words will be matched for `NAME` e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`.
> * Only full room numbers will be matched for `ROOM_NUMBER` e.g. `01-` will not match `01-0110`.
> * Only full contact numbers will be matched for `PHONE`, e.g. `9876` will not match `98765432`.
> * When searching by `NAME`, any contacts matching at least any one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.
> * The order of the `TAGS` does not matter e.g. `t/friends t/colleagues` works the same
  as `t/colleagues t/friends`.
> * Tag search is case-sensitive. `Friends` will not match `friends`.
> * In tag search, the contacts have to contain all the specified TAGs in order to match.
> * If multiple parameters, namely `NAME`, `PHONE`, `ROOM_NUMBER`, and/or `TAG`,  are specified, the results of the search will only contain contacts that match all the specified parameters.

Examples:
* `find n/John` finds contacts who have the word John in their name.
* `find p/94509592 n/Alex Jones r/08-1234 t/friends t/colleagues` finds contacts who have the tags `friends` and `colleagues`. They must also have the `Alex` or `Jones` in their name, `94509592` as their contact number, and live in room `08-1234`.

The following screenshot shows the results of executing `find p/94509592 n/Alex Jones r/08-1234 t/friends t/colleagues`.

<img src="images/FindCommandExampleUsage.png" alt="FindCommand screenshot" height=auto width="850"/>

### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

Format: `delete INDEX`
* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.

> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
>
> * The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
>* There is a confirmation pop-out after the user enters the command but before the deletion is finalised. Click `OK` to continue or `Cancel` to abort the deletion.

The following screenshot shows the delete pop-out.
<img src="images/Delete popup.png" alt="Delete popup screenshot" height=auto width="850"/>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find n/Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find n/Betsy` command.


### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Cleaning graduated students : `clean`

Removes all graduated students from the address book by removing all students with GRADUATION_YEAR fields earlier than the current year.

Format: `clean`

> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
>
> * If you execute `clean` after executing a `find` command, the search results of the `find` command remains in place. Use `list` to see the full effects of the `clean` command.
> * This is such that the results of your query with `find` are not lost after applying `clean`.

> <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen"> TIP! </span> <br>
>
> If you mistakenly entered this command, you can undo it with the `undo` command. See [undo](#undoing-the-previous-command-undo) for details!

Example:
* `clean`, executed in 2024.

The following screenshot shows the result of `clean`, executed in 2024, which deletes all students who graduate in 2023 or earlier.
<img src="images/CleanCommandExampleUsage.png" alt="CleanCommand screenshot" height=auto width="850"/>


### Undoing the previous command : `undo`

Undoes the latest command that changed the data in the address book.

Format: `undo`

> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
>
> * Commands that can be undone are `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `clear`, `clean`, `import`.
> * `undo` can revert such commands repeatedly, all the way back to when the app was first opened.


> <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen"> TIP! </span> <br>
>
> `undo` will display a result message that corresponds its effect to help you keep track of what you are undoing!

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

DorManagerPro data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually, although there is an option to do so in the [export](#manual-saving-export) and [import](#manual-data-restoration-import) functions.

### Manual saving: `export`

The `export` command will directly and immediately save the contents of the data to a save file akin to the one created automatically when closing the application.

Format: `export`

> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
> This exports the data of DorManagerPro to a file `NOW.json` into the data folder of the home folder.
> `NOW` is the time at the point of `export`, in the format MM-dd-yyyy-HHmmssPM.

Example:

The following screenshots shows the results of executing `export`.

<img src="images/ExportCommandExampleUsage.png" alt="ExportCommand screenshot" height=auto width="850"/>

<img src="images/ExportToFolderExample.png" alt="ExportToFolder screenshot" height=auto width="850"/>

### Manual data restoration: `import`
The `import` command allows users to restore data from any one save file into the application.

Format: `import fp/FILE_PATH`

> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
>
> * `FILE_PATH` must correspond to a json file in the device that has at least one valid entry .
> * `import` will not work if the json file to be imported would result in any invalid data in DorManagerPro!
> * Use `.` in the FILE_PATH to refer to the home folder of the application.  (e.g. `./data/SaveFile.json` refers to `SaveFile.json` in the data folder of the home folder)
> * The home folder of the application is the folder that contains the jar file!

Examples:

* `import fp/C:/SaveFile3.json` imports data from the file at `C:/SaveFile3.json` into the application.
* `import fp/./data/SaveFile4.json` imports data from the file `SaveFile4.json` from the `data` folder of the home folder (`.` in the file path refers to the home folder) into the application.

The following screenshot shows the results of executing `import fp/./data/11-08-2024-051337AM.json`.

<img src="images/ImportCommandExampleUsage.png" alt="ImportCommand screenshot" height=auto width="850"/>

> <span style="color:MediumSeaGreen"> TIP! </span> <br>
>
> Importing data will replace all currently existing data in the application with the data in the save file, so do make a backup before importing.
> However, if you mistakenly entered this command, you can always undo it with the `undo` command. See [undo](#undoing-the-previous-command--undo) for details!


### Editing the data file

DorManagerPro data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/DorManagerPro.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

> <span style="color:Tomato"> WARNING! </span> <br>
>
> If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, DorManagerPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Similarly, when trying to import an invalid JSON file, DorManagerPro will raise an error and disallow the import to prevent invalid data.<br>
>Furthermore, certain edits can cause the DorManagerPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous DorManagerPro home folder. You can also use the import and export features to directly manage and modify JSON files that follow DorManagerPros format.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the application window will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

* `name` can contain hyphens, commas, and apostrophes.
* `name` can be 1 to 300 characters long.

Duplicate handling:
* Two resident student contacts with the same name are not allowed.

> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
>
> * Constraint rationale: Extremely long names would be difficult to process and display in the profile screen. It is rather common to use hyphens, commas and apostrophes to separate different sections of the name.
> * Duplicate handling rationale: It is very rare for two people to have the exact same name down to the surname. Instead, we allow numerals to denote different people with the same name.
> * Case-insensitive: `John Doe` is treated the same as `john doe`.

### Phone number

Format: `+c a d`, where `c` is an optional country code, `a` is an optional area code, and `d` is a compulsory number.

Constraints:
* Start the phone number with `+` only if there is a country code.
* `c` is an optional country code 1 to 3 digits long.
* `a` is an optional area code 1 to 4 digits long. `a` can only be specified when `c` is specified.
* `d` is a compulsory number 3 to 15 digits long.
* Separate `c`, `a` and `d` with a single space.

Duplicate handling:
* Two resident student contacts with the same phone numbers are not allowed.
> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
>
> * This section corresponds to the `PHONE` parameter.
> * Constraint rationale: Phone number constraints are based on the upper and lower limit of country codes, area codes, and number digit lengths.
> * Duplicate handling rationale: Phone numbers are unique to each individual.

### Email

Format: `l@d`, where `l` is the local part of the email and `d` is the domain of the email.

Constraints:
* The local-part `l` should only contain alphanumeric characters and these special characters, excluding the parentheses, (+_.-). The local-part may not start or end with any special characters.
* The domain name `d` is made up of domain labels separated by periods.
* The domain name `d` must end with a domain label at least 2 characters long.
* Each domain label must start and end with alphanumeric characters.
* Each domain label must  consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.
* `l`, `@` and `d` are not supposed to be separated by whitespace.

Duplicate handling:

> <span style="color:Gray"> NOTE! </span> <br>
>
> * Constraint rationale: The character limit ensures that the tag is concise for easy referencing. Whitespaces are allowed to define more complex positions that the person may hold, such as "Volleyball captain". A whitespace cannot be the first character, such that " " cannot be a valid input.


### Room number

Format: `FF-RRRR`, where `FF` is the floor number, and `RRRR` is the unit number.

Constraints:
* `FF` is a floor number 2 digits long.
* `RRRR` is a unit number 4 digits long.
