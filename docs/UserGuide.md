<br>

## **Quick start**

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer.
   - To install `Java 17`, download Java. Refer to the [guide for installing Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/overview-jdk-installation.html).
     - Alternatively, download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).
   - To check your Java version, refer [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html#).

<br>

2. You can download our latest release file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/releases). It 
   is a `.jar` file. For more information, you can refer to: 
   - [What is a JAR file?](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jarGuide.html)
   - [How to run a JAR file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5774970/run-jar-file-in-command-prompt).

<br>

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your DocTrack application. 
   - The DocTrack application will create a `data` folder in this _home folder_ to store your [data files](#faq).

<br>

4. Open a [command terminal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line) of your preference, and run the commands:
    ```
    cd HOME_FOLDER
    java -jar DocTrack.jar
   ```
    **_Example:_** if you copied `DocTrack.jar` into the folder `C:/Users/user/Documents`,
    run the commands:
    ```
   cd C:/Users/user/Documents
   java -jar DocTrack.jar
   ```

<br>

5. A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the DocTrack application contains some sample data.
   <br>
   ![Ui](images/Updated_UI.png)

<br>

6. Type the command in the command box, which is indicated by `Enter command here...`. Press `Enter` to execute it.<br>
   _**Example:** Typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window._<br>
   
   Some other examples of commands you can enter:
   * `list person` : Lists all contacts.
   * `add person n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 st/recovering` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
   * `delete person 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
   * `clear person` : Deletes all contacts.
   * `exit` : Exits the app.

<br>

<box type="tip" light>

**Tip:**

This would be a good time to run the `clear person` command, to start afresh without sample data.

</box>

<br>

7. You can refer to the <a href="#command-overview" class="badge bg-primary">Command Overview</a> below for details of each command. 
    * You can also go to the specific subsections:
   <a href="#person-commands" class="badge bg-dark">Person commands</a>

## **Interacting with DocTrack**

All interactions with the DocTrack platform are done through a series of **commands** 
(explained in <a href="#command-overview" class="badge bg-primary">Command Overview</a>) entered by you. 
- These commands allow you to perform various **tasks**, such as adding, editing, listing, deleting, finding, and clearing persons/appointments. 
- The commands are designed to be flexible and user-friendly.

<box type="tip" light>

Here are some **key points** to keep in mind when you are using the commands:

- **Appointments** are sorted by **date**. **Patients** are sorted in **chronological** order.
- You should supply **all** the fields (words in **`UPPER_CASE`**) that are needed for a command.<br>
  _**Example:** In `add person n/NAME`, **`NAME`** is a field which can be used as `add person n/John Doe`._

- The **`INDEX`** in command formats like `edit person INDEX` and `delete appt INDEX` refers to the index 
  number (shown beside the person or appointment) in the displayed list. The index **must be a positive integer i.e. 1, 2, 3...** <br>
  _**Example:** The index of the first person displayed at the top the list is `1`, the index of the second person displayed is `2`, and so on._

- Items in **square** brackets **`[]`** are **optional**. <br>
  _**Example:** `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`._

- Items with `…​` after them can be used **zero times or more times**. <br>
  _**Example:**`[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc._

- You can add fields in **any order**. <br>
  _**Example:** If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, then `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable._

<box type="tip" theme="success" light style="border: 1px solid">

**Tip:** 

If you add extraneous fields for commands that do not take in fields (such as `help`, `list person`, 
`list appt`, `exit` and `clear`), they will be ignored. <br>
_**Example:** If the command specifies `help 123`, then it will be interpreted as `help`._

</box>

<box type="warning" light style="border: 1px solid red">

**Caution:**

If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines. This is because some space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over.

<box type="info" light seamless>

**Notes:**

**1.** The **email** must have
*  a local part containing alphanumeric characters and specific symbols (such as `+` 
  `_` `.` `-`) (not at the start or end), 
* followed by `@`, and a domain part with labels separated by periods, 
* ending in a label with at least two alphanumeric characters, 
* and no labels starting or ending with hyphens.

</box>

You can identify these patients uniquely by their **patient ID (PID)** for easy reference.
The **PID** can be seen in the top right corner of their information card, as shown below:<br><br>
<img src="images/personexample.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right:auto;">

### **Appointment Commands**

An **appointment** is defined by several fields. The fields and their corresponding prefixes are as follows:

| Field                | Prefix | Optional | Multiple | Acceptable Inputs                         |
|----------------------|--------|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Person ID**        | `i/`   | No       | No       | Existing person ID                        |
| **Appointment Type** | `ty/`  | No       | No       | Any value                                 |
| **Date and Time**    | `d/`   | No       | No       | `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`. Refer to **1.** below |
| **Sickness**         | `s/`   | Yes      | No       | At least one alphabetic character         |
| **Medicine**         | `m/`   | Yes      | No       | At least one alphabetic character         |

<br>

You can identify these appointments uniquely by their **Appointment ID (AID)** for easy reference.
The **AID** can be seen in the top right corner of their information card, as shown below:<br><br>
<img src="images/appointmentexample.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; 
margin-right: auto;">
* The number indicated beside the appointment name is the **PID** of the person who has the appointment.


You can manage the appointments through different commands, which can be seen in the table below:

<box type="info" light seamless>

**Notes:**

**1.** Acceptable inputs for **Date and Time**:
* The time is in 24-hour format, i.e. `HH:mm` should be between `00:00` and `23:59`.
* The date and time inputs are resolved "smartly" - meaning that certain incorrect dates will be allowed.<br> _**Example:**`2025-02-29 12:00` will be parsed as `2025-02-28 12:00`._

<br>

##### Saving the data

The data of the patients and appointments are saved in the hard disk automatically after you run any command that changes the data. You do not need to save them manually.
- For more information on how the data is stored, you can refer to <a href="#faq" class="badge bg-warning">FAQs</a>.

<br>

##### Editing the data file

For advanced users, feel free to update patient and appointment data directly by editing the [data files](#faq) in the 
`data` folder. Learn more here: <a href="#faq" class="badge bg-warning">FAQs</a>.

<box type="warning" light>

**Caution:**

- If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, DocTrack will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended that you have a backup of the file before 
  editing it.<br>
- Furthermore, certain edits can cause DocTrack to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, you should edit the data file only if you are confident that you 
  can update it correctly.

## **FAQ**

**Q**: How is my data stored?<br>
**A**: Your data is stored in [.json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files, located in the `data` 
folder. The details of the persons are stored in the `addressbook.json` file, while the appointments are stored in the `appointmentbook.json` file.

Examples:

An example of how the persons are stored in the `addressbook.json` file:

```json
{
  "persons": [
    {
      "personId": 0,
      "name": "Alex Yeoh",
      "phone": "87438807",
      "email": "alexyeoh@example.com",
      "address": "Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40",
      "status": "Recovering",
      "tags": [
        "friends"
      ]
    },
    {
      "personId": 1,
      "name": "Bernice Yu",
      "phone": "99272758",
      "email": "berniceyu@example.com",
      "address": "Blk 30 Lorong 3 Serangoon Gardens, #07-18",
      "status": "Stable",
      "tags": [
        "colleagues",
        "friends"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

An example of how the appointments are stored in the `appointmentbook.json` file:

```json
{
  "appointments": [
    {
      "appointmentId": 0,
      "appointmentType": "Consultation",
      "appointmentDateTime": "2024-10-20T09:30",
      "personId": 0,
      "sickness": "Flu",
      "medicine": "Antiviral"
    },
    {
      "appointmentId": 1,
      "appointmentType": "Follow-up",
      "appointmentDateTime": "2024-10-22T14:00",
      "personId": 1,
      "sickness": "Diabetes",
      "medicine": "Insulin"
    }
  ]
}
```
<br><br>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data (in the `addressbook.json` and `appointmentbook.json` files) to another 
computer?<br>
**A**: 
1. Save the `addressbook.json` and `appointmentbook.json` files from the `data` folder in your current computer.
2. [Install the DocTrack app](#quick-start) in the other computer. 
3. When you run DocTrack, it creates empty [.json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files in the `data` 
   folder. 
4. Replace these empty files with the `addressbook.json` and `appointmentbook.json` files you saved from your previous computer.

<br>

**Q**: Can I access DocTrack without internet connection?<br>
**A**: Yes, you can run DocTrack without an internet connection.

<br>

**Q**: How do I back up my data?<br>
**A**: Since the data is saved in the `addressbook.json` and `appointmentbook.json` files in the `data` 
folder, you can copy these files to another location as a backup.

<br>

**Q**: How many patients and appointments does DocTrack support? <br>
**A**: DocTrack technically supports up to 4 billion total **historical** patients and appointments. However,
depending on your system, it might lag with larger numbers of patients and appointments. 
We recommend that you do not exceed 10,000 total patients and appointments.

<br>

## **Known issues**

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

<br>

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

<br>

3. On **MacOS systems**, the bold fonts may appear slightly clipped.

<br>

4. Editing the name in the `edit person` command will not reflect the name change in the appointments until a reload of the application.
