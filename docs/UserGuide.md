# Bridal Boss User Guide

**Bridal Boss** is a desktop app designed for small to medium-scale **wedding planners to streamline contact management**. 
It is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, Bridal Boss will help you manage contacts faster than traditional GUI apps, combining speed with functionality to enhance your wedding planning experience. 

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar BridalBoss.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   <img src="images/Ui.png" alt="Ui" width="500"/>
1. At the top is the command box for users to enter their commands. The column on the left contains the list of client and vendor contacts while the right column contains a list of weddings. <br>

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John` to Bridal Boss.

   * `view 3` : Views the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Common Scenarios

### Understanding the Address Book Structure

Bridal Boss manages two main types of entries:
1. **Contacts List**: Shows all people in your address book
    - Clients (people who have their own wedding)
    - Vendors (people who can be assigned to weddings)

2. **Weddings List**: Shows all weddings with their:
    - Wedding name
    - Client
    - Date (if specified)
    - Venue (if specified)
    - Assigned vendors

Here are some common scenarios to help you understand how to use Bridal Boss:
#### 1. Setting Up a New Client's Wedding
1. First, add the client as a contact:
   `add n/Sarah Chen p/91234567 e/sarah@example.com a/123 Orchard Road`
   [↗ See add command details](#adding-a-person-add)

2. Create their wedding:
   `addw n/Sarah's Garden Wedding c/Sarah Chen d/2024-12-25 v/Botanical Gardens`
   [↗ See addw command details](#adding-a-wedding-addw)

3. View the created wedding:
   `vieww Sarah`
   [↗ See vieww command details](#viewing-wedding-details-vieww)

#### 2. Managing Vendors for a Wedding
1. Add vendors as contacts:<br>
   `add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/john@photo.com a/456 River Valley r/photographer`<br>
   `add n/Mary Tan p/82345678 e/mary@flowers.com a/789 Garden Road r/florist`

2. Assign them to a wedding (use `list` first to see indices):<br>
   `assign John Doe w/1`<br>
   `assign Mary Tan w/1`<br>
   [↗ See assign command details](#assigning-a-person-assign)

3. Check wedding assignments:
   `vieww 1`

#### 3. Making Changes to Existing Entries
1. Update contact details:<br>
   `edit John Doe p/91234599       # Update phone number`<br>
   `edit Mary Tan a/100 New Road   # Update address`<br>
   [↗ See edit command details](#editing-a-person-edit)

2. Modify wedding details:<br>
   `editw w/1 d/2024-12-31         # Change date`<br>
   `editw w/1 v/New Venue          # Change venue`<br>
   [↗ See editw command details](#editing-a-wedding-editw)

#### 4. Finding and Filtering Contacts
1. Search by name (exact name match):
   `find john                      # Finds "John" or "John Doe"`
   [↗ See find command details](#finding-persons-by-name-find)

2. Filter by multiple criteria:<br>
   `filter r/photographer          # All photographers`<br>
   `filter n/John r/photographer   # Johns or photographers`<br>
   [↗ See filter command details](#filtering-persons-filter)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Creating a wedding without adding the client first
   `addw n/Beach Wedding c/John Doe   # Fails if John isn't a contact`

   ✅ Correct approach:<br>
   `add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/john@example.com a/123 Main St`<br>
   `addw n/Beach Wedding c/John Doe`

2. ❌ Trying to delete a client who has a wedding
   `delete John   # Fails if John has an active wedding`

   ✅ Correct approach:<br>
   `deletew 1     # Delete the wedding first`<br>
   `delete John   # Then delete the contact`

3. ❌ Assigning a client to their own wedding as vendor
   `assign Sarah Chen w/1    # Fails if wedding 1 is Sarah's wedding`

   ✅ Correct approach:
    - Clients cannot be vendors in their own wedding
    - Create a new contact if the same person is both client and vendor

### Quick Tips
- Use `list` frequently to see updated indices
- For name-based commands, use index if you get multiple matches
- Check [validation rules](#validation-rules) when adding/editing entries
- Check [general command format](#general-command-format) for command structure
- Check [general command details](#general-command-details) for detailed command usage
- View the [command summary](#command-summary) for quick reference

#### Exiting the Program: `exit`

Exits the application.

---

#### Saving the Data

- **Automatic Saving**:
    - Data is automatically saved after any command that modifies the data.
- **Storage Location**:
    - Data is saved as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`.

[↥ Back to Top](#bridal-boss-user-guide)

---

#### Editing the Data File

Advanced users can edit the data file directly to modify the address book data. However, exercise caution when doing so.

- **File Location**:
    - `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`
- **Caution**:
    - **Backup First**:
        - Make a copy of the data file before editing.
    - **Validity**:
        - Incorrect file formats or invalid data can cause the application to discard all data and start with an empty data file upon the next run.
          - Changing ownWedding field of a person to 0 will only result in wedding having no client and would not corrupt the file.
          - However, changing the hashcode of the `weddingJobs` to an incorrect value will result in a corrupted file and restart the application with an empty data file.
- **Recommendation**:
    - Edit the data file only if you are confident in updating it correctly.

---

### Additional Notes

- **Using PDFs**:
    - When copying commands from a PDF, ensure that spaces and line-breaks are correctly maintained to avoid errors.
- **Error Messages**:
    - The application provides specific error messages to guide users in correcting their commands.
- **Case Sensitivity**:
  - Commands must be **lowercase** (`add, addw, edit, editw etc.`)
  - Parameters prefixes (`n/..., e/...` ) are **case-sensitive**.

## 📚 **FAQ**

**Q**: **How do I transfer my data to another Computer?**  
**A**: 🖥️ Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

---

**Q**: **How do I input the name of a person with `d/o` or `s/o` in it?**  
**A**: ✏️ You can input the name as `son of` or `daughter of` respectively.

---

**Q**: **How do I add a wedding for an existing client?**  
**A**: First, use `list` to see all contacts. Then, use either `addw n/WEDDING_NAME c/INDEX` using the client's index number, or `addw n/WEDDING_NAME c/CLIENT_NAME` using the client's name.

---

**Q**: **What happens if I try to delete a client who has a wedding?**  
**A**: ⚠️ The system will prevent you from deleting the client and show an error message. You must first delete the client's wedding before deleting the contact.

---

**Q**: **Can I change a wedding's client after creation?**  
**A**: ❌ No, a wedding's client cannot be changed after creation. You would need to create a new wedding for the different client.

---

**Q**: **Can a client have multiple weddings?**  
**A**: 📅 No, each client can only have one wedding at a time.

---

**Q**: **Can I assign multiple roles to a person?**  
**A**: 🚫 No, each person can only have at most one role at a time. Assigning a new role will replace the existing one.

---

**Q**: **What happens when I delete a wedding?**  
**A**: Deleting a wedding will remove all vendor assignments to that wedding and remove the client-wedding relationship. The contacts themselves are not deleted.

---

**Q**: **Can I use the same phone number or email for different contacts?**  
**A**: 📛 No, phone numbers and email addresses must be unique in the system. You'll receive an error message if you try to add or edit a contact with duplicate information.

---

**Q**: **What happens if I find multiple contacts with the same name?**  
**A**: When using name-based commands, if multiple matches are found, the system will show you a list of matching contacts with their indices. You'll need to use the index number to specify which contact you want to work with.

---

**Q**: **How can I see all weddings a vendor is assigned to?**  
**A**: Use the `view` command with the vendor's name or index. The system will show all weddings they are assigned to as part of their contact details.

---

**Q**: **Can I search for contacts by partial name match?**  
**A**: ✅ Yes, use the `find` command which matches partial names. However, note that it matches whole words only (e.g., "John" will match "John Doe" but not "Johnny").

---

**Q**: **What's the difference between `find` and `filter` commands?**  
**A**: `find` and `filter` have different search capabilities:
- **`find`**:
    - 🔍 Searches only names
    - Supports partial word matches
    - Allows multiple name searches (e.g., `find alex david` returns both `Alex Yeoh` and `David Li`)
    - Uses OR logic (matches any keyword)

- **`filter`**:
    - Can search across multiple fields (name, role, email, phone, address)
    - Requires exact word matches for names and roles
    - Each field can only have one value - if you specify multiple values for the same field, only the last one is used
        - e.g., `filter n/John n/Peter` will only search for "Peter"
    - Uses OR logic between different fields
        - e.g., `filter n/John r/vendor` returns contacts with either name "John" OR role "vendor"
    - Cannot search for multiple names like `find` does - must use exact single name

---

**Q**: **How do I remove a role from a contact?**  
**A**: Roles can be removed using the assign command.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: `assign 1 r/` to remove the role of person at index 1.

---

**Q**: **What happens to wedding assignments if I edit a contact's details?**  
**A**: ✏️ Editing a contact's basic details (name, phone, email, address) does not affect their wedding assignments or role. These relationships remain intact.

---

**Q**: **Can I export my contact and wedding data?**  
**A**: While there's no direct export command, you can copy the data file (addressbook.json) which contains all your data. This file is located in the same folder as the application.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. Persons are able to have multiple weddings on the same day.
4. Client of a wedding can be assigned another wedding job (for a different wedding) on the same day.
5. Long fields (more than 50 characters) may not display fully in the GUI.
6. Incorrect error message shown when the number entered is too large.
7. User may not be able to "unclick" after clicking on a field on the GUI.
8. User may be able to add weddings that are in the past.
9. Adjusting the window size may cause the GUI to display to hide wedding details.<br>
