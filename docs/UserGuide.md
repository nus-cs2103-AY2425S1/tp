# Prudy User Guide

Prudy is a **desktop app for Prudential financial agents to manage client policies and claims.** It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Prudy can get your client management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

What is Prudy used for:

- **Client Management:** Record important information of client's personal details such as their name and phone numbers, as well as their policies and claims.

- **Keyboard Centric Executions:** Prudy's commands are executed mostly using the keyboard instead of traditional point-and-click using the mouse, ensuring swift navigation without moving your hand from the keyboard, then to the mouse, and back to the keyboard repeatedly!

- **Filter Data:** Filter through clients and policies using our intuitive find functions.

- **Autosave:** Data in Prudy is automatically saved after each command, removing the need to manually save before closing the application and concerns for losing data.

In this guide, you’ll learn how to:

- **Set Up Prudy** to start managing client policies and claims with ease.
- **Navigate and Use Key Features** such as adding, editing, and filtering client data, along with managing policies and claims.
- **Optimize Your Workflow** by leveraging Prudy’s command-based data entry, powerful filtering options, and automatic data saving for streamlined client and policy management.

Now, let’s get started and unlock the full potential of Prudy for efficient client management!

<br>

6. If you are a beginner, we recommend that you check out the [Command Structure](#4-command-structure) section to find out more about command syntax. Otherwise, you may also choose to skip and proceed directly to the [Command Overview](#5-command-overview) section for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Command Structure

Understanding the structure of Prudy’s commands will allow you to use the application more effectively. Each command in Prudy consists of **Commands**, **Flags**, and **Arguments**. This section explains each of these components and how they work together to execute actions in Prudy.

---

### 4.1 Overview

Prudy commands are structured to be straightforward and efficient, consisting of three parts:
1. **Command**: The main action, such as `add-client` or `delete-client`.
2. **Flags**: Short prefixes that define specific data fields, like `n/` for name or `p/` for phone.
3. **Arguments**: The actual values provided for each flag, such as a client’s name or email.

Here’s an example to demonstrate the structure:
```shell
add-client n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/123 Elm St
````
In this command:

- **Command**: `add-client` instructs Prudy to add a new client.
- **Flags**: `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, and `a/` specify the data fields (name, phone, email, address).
- **Arguments**: `John Doe`, `98765432`, `johnd@example.com`, and `123 Elm St` are the values for each flag.

---

### 4.2 Commands

Commands represent the **primary actions** Prudy will perform. Each command initiates a specific function within the app. These are **case-sensitive** as we want you to be very clear with what commands you want to execute. For example, typing `Exit` instead of `exit` is invalid. Here are the main commands:

| Command                  | Description                                                          |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `add-client`             | Adds a new client.                                                   |
| `edit-client`            | Modifies an existing client’s details.                               |

| `list-clients`           | Lists all clients stored in Prudy.                                   |
| `find-client`            | Searches clients based on specified criteria.                        |
| `add-policy`             | Adds a policy to a specific client.                                  |
| `delete-policy`          | Removes a policy or multiple policies from a specific client.        |
| `edit-policy`            | Modifies an existing policy of a client.                             |
| `list-policies`          | Lists all policies of a specific client.                             |
| `list-expiring-policies` | Lists all policies that are expiring after specified number of days. |
| `add-claim`              | Adds a claim under a client's policy.                                |
| `delete-claim`           | Removes a claim from a client's policy.                              |
| `edit-claim`             | Modifies an exisiting claim.                                         |
| `list-claims`            | Lists all claims under a specified client's policy.                  |
| `clear`                  | Deletes all client data, resetting Prudy.                            |
| `exit`                   | Closes the Prudy application.                                        |

These are the overview of Prudy's commands, please refer to [Command Overview](#5-command-overview) for a comprehensive list of Prudy's features.

---

### 4.3 Flags

**Flags** are used within commands to define **specific types of data** that Prudy will handle. They allow you to quickly indicate what information you’re providing. These are also **case-sensitive**. Below is a list of flags you can use:

| Flag  | Data Type              |
|-------|------------------------|
| `n/`  | Name                   |
| `p/`  | Phone                  |

In Prudy, arguments ensure that the command functions as expected. Without correct arguments, Prudy may display an error message indicating the input is invalid.

<div style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #D6EAF8; margin-bottom: 16px;">

🔔
**Note:**

* Prudy allows flexibility in date inputs for February due to the variable number of days (28 or 29) depending on the year. If an invalid date between the maximum day of February and `02/31` is entered, Prudy will automatically adjust it to the maximum valid date for February in that year.

   **Examples:**
  * `02/31/2023` and `02/29/2023` will be automatically converted to `02/28/2023`.
  * `02/30/2024` and `02/31/2024` will be automatically converted to `02/29/2024`.
</div>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Info:**
In the following [Command Overview](#5-command-overview) section below, arguments and flags enclosed in square brackets <code>[]</code> are optional, while those suffixed with <code>…</code> can be used any number of times. For example, in the command <code>add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​</code>, the <code>[t/TAG]</code> part is optional and can be omitted if not needed. Furthermore, you can input multiple <code>[t/TAG]</code> in the above command.

## 5. Command Overview

This section will guide you on the commands available and how to use them correctly to optimise your workflow. If you have trouble understanding the command syntax, we highly recommend that you refer back to [Command Structure](#4-command-structure) as  basic knowledge of the command structure will give you a better understanding of our commands.

Prudy uses a command-line interface with **four primary categories** of commands to manage various aspects of **client data, policies**, and **claims**. Each command type serves a distinct purpose:

1. **General Commands**: Used for basic navigation, help, saving, and exiting the program.
2. **Client Management Commands**: Commands to add, edit, delete, and filter client information.
3. **Policy Management Commands**: Commands to manage policies for each client, including adding, editing, and deleting policies.
4. **Claims Management Commands**: Commands for managing client claims, including adding, editing, and deleting claims.

<div style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #D6EAF8; margin-bottom: 16px;">

🔔
**Note:**
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored. e.g., if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
</div>

---

### 5.1 General Commands

These commands help with **general navigation**, displaying help information, saving data, and exiting the program.

---

#### 5.1.1 Viewing Help : `help`
Shows a message explaining how to **access the help page**.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

**Format:**

```
help
```

---

#### 5.1.2 Clearing All Entries: `clear`
**Clears all entries** from Prudy, resetting the data.

**Format:**

```
clear
```

<div style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #FADBD8; margin-bottom: 16px;">

❗️
**Warning:**
This action is destructive and irreversible.
</div>

---

#### 5.1.3 Exiting the Program: `exit`
**Exits** the program.

**Format:**

```
exit
```

---

#### 5.1.4 Saving the Data
Prudy **automatically saves data** to the hard disk after every command that modifies the data. Manual saving is **not required**.

---

#### 5.1.5 Editing the Data File
Prudy data is **automatically saved** as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/prudy.json`. Advanced users may edit this file directly to update the data.

<div style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #FADBD8; margin-bottom: 16px;">

❗️
**Warning:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Prudy will start with an empty data file at the next run. Subsequently, if you were to enter a command that modifies the data (e.g., <code>add-client</code>), Prudy will discard the old data, and replace with the new one. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause Prudy to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

More on how to edit the data file in future updates!

### 5.2 Client Management Commands

**Client management commands** allow you to add, edit, delete, and filter client data.

---

#### 5.2.1 Adding a Client: `add-client`

Adds a **new client** to Prudy.

**Format:**
```shell
add-client n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​
```

| **Parameter Name** | **Description**            | **Requirements**                                                       | **Required** |

<div style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #FCF3CF; margin-bottom: 16px;">

💡
**Tip:**
A client can have any number of tags (including 0).
</div>

**Examples:**
* `add-client n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add-client n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Yishun Street 22, Block 245, #04-02 p/1234567 t/owesMoney`

<div style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #D6EAF8; margin-bottom: 16px;">

🔔
**Note:**
* `NAME` currently does not accept special characters such as `/`, `@`, and `,`. This functionality will be added in coming updates. For more information on the requirements of each arguments, refer back to [Arguments](#4-4-arguments).
* Clients are considered duplicates if `NAME` and `PHONE` match with another existing client.
</div>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Info:**
Currently, Prudy treats client names as case-sensitive. This means that names entered with different cases, such as `John Tan` and `john Tan`, will be treated as separate clients in the system. 

To maintain data consistency, we recommend agents verify name formats before adding clients to ensure the first letter is capitalized for each word in a name, e.g., `John Tan` instead of `john tan`.
</box>

**On success:**
```shell
New client added: NAME; Phone: PHONE; Email: EMAIL; Address: ADDRESS; Tags: TAG
```

<div style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #D6EAF8; margin-bottom: 16px;">

🔔
**Note:**
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g., `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g., `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Only full words will be matched e.g., `Han` will not match `Hans`.
* Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g., `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`.
* Only clients that match all parameters specified will be returned.
  e.g., `n/han pt/life` will return only clients that has `han` in his name and has a Life policy.
</div>

**Examples:**
* `find-client n/John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find-client n/alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`

<div style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #FADBD8; margin-bottom: 16px;">

❗️
**Warning:**
For the next few commands, an `INDEX` parameter is required. This `INDEX` is based on the current list of clients shown in Prudy.
            This means that if Prudy has 2 clients: <code>Alex</code> and <code>Bernice</code> given in that order, and you did <code>find-client n/bernice</code> to filter out <code>Alex</code>. An INDEX of <code>1</code> will refer to <code>Bernice</code> instead of <code>Alex</code>.
</div>

**On success:**
This command modifies the main client list display as well.<br>

🔔
**Note:**
* Non-negative `DAYS` arguments will result in an error.
* Preceding zeros in the `DAYS` argument will be ignored. For example, `list-expiring-policies 0023` and `list-expiring-policies 023` will both be treated as `list-expiring-policies 23`.

🔔
**Note:**
* This command will not allow adding a claim if the client has no policy of the specified type.
* This command will not allow adding a claim if a similar claim already exists. This is to prevent accidental adding of duplicate claims.
* Two claims are consider similar if they have the same `CLAIM_STATUS` and `CLAIM_DESCRIPTION`.
* `POLICY_TYPE` is case-insensitive and can be either `life`, `health`, or `education`.
</div>


**Examples:**

* `add-claim 1 pt/health s/pending d/stomach surgery` adds a claim with status "pending" and description "stomach surgery" to the health policy of the 1st client.

**Note:**
* `POLICY_TYPE` is case-insensitive and can be either `life`, `health`, or `education`.
* `CLAIM_INDEX` is the position of the claim in the policy's claim list.
* If the specified client, policy type, or claim does not exist, an error message will be shown.
</div>

<div style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #FCF3CF; margin-bottom: 16px;">

💡
**Tip:**
You can use the `list-claims` command to find the appropriate claim index for the specified policy type.
</div>

**Examples:**
* `delete-claim 1 pt/health c/1` deletes the claim at index 1 in the `health` policy of the 1st client.
* `delete-claim 3 pt/life c/2` deletes the claim at index 2 in the `life` policy of the 3rd client.

**On success:**
```shell
Claim deleted for policy type POLICY_TYPE of client: NAME

Deleted Claim Details:
Status: CLAIM_STATUS | Description: CLAIM_DESCRIPTION
Note: The indexing of remaining claims may have changed due to this deletion.

<div style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #FCF3CF; margin-bottom: 16px;">

💡
**Tip:**
You can use the `list-claims` command to find the appropriate claim index for the specified policy type.
</div>

**Examples:**
* `edit-claim 1 pt/health c/1 s/approved d/Updated surgery details` edits the first claim in the health policy of the 1st client, updating the status to "approved" and the description to "Updated surgery details".
* `edit-claim 2 pt/life c/2 s/pending` updates the status of the second claim in the life policy of the 2nd client to "pending".

**On success:**
```shell
Claim edited for policy type POLICY_TYPE of client: NAME

Updated Claim Details:
Status: CLAIM_STATUS | Description: CLAIM_DESCRIPTION
```

#### 5.4.4 Listing All Claims: `list-claims`
Lists **all claims** under the specified policy type for the client identified by the index number used in the displayed client list.

**Format:**
```
list-claims INDEX pt/POLICY_TYPE
```

| **Parameter Name** | **Description**                                       | **Requirements**                                          | **Required** |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| INDEX              | The index of the client in the displayed client list. | Positive integer, must correspond to a valid client index | yes          |
| pt/POLICY_TYPE     | The policy type under which claims are listed         | Predefined types (e.g., life, health, education)          | yes          |


<div style="border: 1px solid #e0e0e0; padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #D6EAF8; margin-bottom: 16px;">

🔔
**Note:**
* The claims are listed in the order they were added.
* No filtering or sorting is applied by this command; it shows all existing claims.
* The `list-claims` command does not alter the main client list display. Instead, it only shows the claim details in the message output box at the top. This behavior is different from `list-clients`, which modifies the main display.
</div>

**Examples:**
* `list-claims 1 pt/health` lists all claims of the health policy for the first client.

**On success:**
```shell
Claims listed for policy type POLICY_TYPE of client: NAME

1. Claim Status: CLAIM_STATUS | Claim Description: CLAIM_DESCRIPTION
```

## 6. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Prudy home folder.

**Q**: Why am I getting an error when executing commands?<br>
**A**: Ensure that the command syntax (e.g., `list-claims INDEX pt/POLICY_TYPE`) is correct, and that the flags (e.g., `pt/`) are entered correctly. You can refer to [Command Structure](#4-command-structure) to better understand the command structure.

**Q**: Does Prudy support special characters in client names or addresses?<br>
**A**: Currently, Prudy does not support special characters in client names. However, addresses and emails can include alphanumeric characters and symbols.

**Q**: What should I do if Prudy shows an error message saying "invalid index"?<br>
**A**: Ensure that the index you entered corresponds to an actual client or policy in the current displayed list. If you recently filtered the list, the index may differ from the full list.

**Q**: Can I recover data if I accidentally use the clear command?<br>
**A**: The clear command permanently deletes all data in Prudy and cannot be undone. It is recommended to back up your data file regularly to prevent accidental data loss.

## 7. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **Clients with names consisting of special characters is not valid** in Prudy for now. The remedy is to omit these special characters when entering these clients' names.
4. **Avoid opening multiple Prudy instances,** any changes made on one instance of Prudy will not be instantly reflected in the other instance.
