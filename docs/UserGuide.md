Supply Central is a **desktop app for managing suppliers, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SupplyCentral can get your supplier management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. This app aims to resolve the pain points of small business owners by helping them with information handling. This app is based on the Address Book 3 (AB3) project.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the provided command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Saving the data

Supply Central data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

SupplyCentral supplier data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, SupplyCentral will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause SupplyCentral to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

### Editing the Goods data file ###

SupplyCentral goods data will be stored in a CSV file for advanced users to access and use for business purposes. However, it is strongly discouraged for users to directly edit this data file due to risk of data corruption.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Similar to the supplier data file, if your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, SupplyCentral will discard all invalid data and will only retain any valid data within the current file. Hence, as mentioned above, it is strongly discouraged to directly edit this file.<br>
</div>

### Resizing UI elements

SupplyCental allows you to resize the UI elements to better fit your screen. You can resize the UI elements by clicking and dragging the dividers as highlighted below.

![Draggable UI elements](images/DraggableUI.png)

The elements will resize according to the position of the divider, allocating more space for the output to be displayed, or more space for the suppliers/goods to be displayed.

### Delivery status

The delivery status of the goods can be easily seen through the color of the goods name. The color of the goods name will be yellow if the delivery status is `PENDING` and will change to green if the delivery status is `Delivered`, as shown in the image below.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
