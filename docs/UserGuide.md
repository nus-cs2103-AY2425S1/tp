## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your SalesContactPro.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar SalesContactPro.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to SalesContactPro.

   * `delete John Doe` : Deletes the John Doe contact.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/client` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items in angular brackets are options.<br>
  e.g `i/<none/low/mid/high>` can be used as `i/low` or as `i/high` or using other valid options.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/client`, `t/client t/colleague` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

### Viewing help: `help`

Displays a summary of commands available.
Shows a message explaining how to access the help page at the bottom.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to SalesContactPro. People with **both** exact same **Name** (case-sensitive) and **Phone** are not allowed.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [nt/NOTES] [i/INCOME<none/low/mid/high>] [age/AGE] [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
While we allow any letter for names for flexibility, our primary language is English, and any formatting errors due to other languages is not part of our scope.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe, Alexander p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 i/high age/33`
* `add n/Betsy d/o Crowe t/boss e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Jurong West Street p/+651234567 t/golf i/MID age/56`
* `add n/Mary Jane t/client p/+651234567 i/low age/24`

### Listing all persons: `list`

Shows a list of all persons in SalesContactPro. The list can be optionally sorted by various fields to help you organize and find contacts more efficiently.

Format: `list [s/SORT_FIELD] [r/]`

* `s/SORT_FIELD`: The field to sort by, defaults to name if not specified. Valid values are:
  * `name` - Sort by contact name in lexicographical order
  * `email` - Sort by email address in lexicographical order
  * `age` - Sort by age
  * `income` - Sort by income
* `r/`: Reverses the sort order (descending instead of ascending)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Important Note:**
Sorting is case-sensitive. When sorting by name:
* Names starting with uppercase letters (e.g., "Alice") appear before names starting with lowercase letters (e.g., "bob")
* To ensure consistent sorting, it is recommended to always capitalize the first letter of names when adding contacts
* Example sort order: "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "alice", "bob"
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If you notice names appearing lower in the sorted list than expected, check if they were entered with correct capitalization. You can use the `edit` command to fix the capitalization if needed.
</div>

Examples:
* `list` - Shows all contacts
* `list s/name` - Lists all contacts sorted alphabetically by name (A to Z)
  <img src="images/listName.png" alt="List sorted by name">
* `list s/email r/` - Lists all contacts sorted by email in reverse order (Z to A)
  <img src="images/listEmail.png" alt="List sorted by email reverse">

Expected outcome for `list s/name`:
```
Listed all persons
Results:
1. Alice Pauline (Phone: 94351253)
2. Benson Meier (Phone: 98765432)
...
```

### Editing a person: `edit`

Edits an existing person in SalesContactPro. People with **both** exact same **Name** (case-sensitive) and **Phone** are not allowed.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [i/INCOME<none/low/mid/high>] [age/AGE] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
    specifying any tags after it.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
If multiple `i/` or `age/` fields are indicated, the app will use the last one for each.
</div>

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords. If no exact match is found, SalesContactPro displays the names in decreasing order of similarity to search term.

Format: `find KEYWORD [KEYWORD]...`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Partial words will be matched e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
* If no exact match is found, SalesContactPro displays the names in decreasing order of similarity to search term.

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john`, `John Doe`, and `Johnny`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)
* `find Ifan` sorts other names by decreasing similarity to `Ifan` (e.g. Irfan, Isolde, Ayush, ...)

### Filtering persons by criteria: `filter`

Filters the displayed list of persons in SalesContactPro to include all persons who meet the specified criteria and displays them with index numbers.

Format: `filter [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​ [i/INCOME_GROUP…​] [age/AGE_CRITERIA…​]`

Parameters:
* `p/PHONE`: The phone number criteria to filter by. For multiple phone numbers, it checks if any phone number is present.
* `e/EMAIL`: The email criteria to filter by. For multiple emails, it checks if any email is present.
* `a/ADDRESS`: The address criteria to filter by. For multiple addresses, it checks if any address is present.
* `t/TAG…​`: The tags to filter by. For multiple tags, it checks if **all** tags are present.
* `i/INCOME_GROUP…​`: The income group criteria to filter by. Valid values are `none`, `low`, `medium`, and `high` (case sensitive). Multiple income values can be used in the same `i/`, and will check with an `OR` criteria.
* `age/AGE_CRITERIA…​`: The age criteria to filter by. A valid age criteria can only contain `<`, `>`, or numbers. If it contains `<` or `>`, there must only be a single instance of either of them, and only as the first character. It cannot contain both. If only numbers are given, equality is checked. For multiple age criteria used in the same `age/`, it checks if all **age** criteria are satisfied.

**Examples**:
* `filter p/+65 e/example.com a/Clementi t/Inactive i/low age/>20 <60`: Filters the list to include all persons whose phone number contains `+65`, email contains `example.com`, address contains `Clementi`, have the tag `Inactive`, belong to the `low` income group, and are aged between 21 and 59.
* `filter p/987 e/johndoe@example.com a/Street i/medium high age/30`: Filters the list to include all persons whose phone number contains `987`, email is `johndoe@example.com`, address contains `Street`, belong to either the `medium` or `high` income group, and are exactly 30 years old.

**Notes**:
* At least one of `p/PHONE`, `e/EMAIL`, `a/ADDRESS`, `i/INCOME_GROUP`, `age/AGE_CRITERIA` or `t/TAG…` must be provided.
* If a contact does not have a value for the criteria field, it is not displayed.
* Multiple criteria for phone, email, address, tags, income group, and age can be specified, separated by spaces.
* The criteria for phone, email, address, and tags are case-insensitive and can be partial matches.
* The criteria income group only checks for exact matches.

### Managing contact notes: `notes`

### Saving the data

### Editing the data file

SalesContactPro data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, SalesContactPro will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the SalesContactPro to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous SalesContactPro home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known limitations

1. **Help Window content issues**: The current Help Window content is quite wordy, and some command formats are cut off halfway.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **No horizontal scrolling for lengthy fields**, which may cause UI display issues.
4. **Tag names only accept alphanumeric characters**, special characters like hyphens are not allowed.
5. **Phone number error message**: The error message only states that "+" is allowed, but does not mention that it should be at the beginning.
6. **Cannot filter for empty fields**.
7. **The edit command processes multiple INCOME or AGE parameters** in a single command, using only the last value.
8. **Contact names are case-sensitive**, potentially allowing duplicate entries with different capitalization.

Please keep these limitations in mind when using the application. We are working to address them in future updates.
