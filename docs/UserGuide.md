<br>

## **Quick start**

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your computer.
   - To install `Java 17`, download Java. Refer to the [guide for installing Java](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/install/overview-jdk-installation.html).
     - Alternatively, download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).
   - To check your Java version, refer [here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html#).

<br>

2. You can download our latest release file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases). It 
   is a `.jar` file. For more information, you can refer to: 
   - [What is a JAR file?](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/jar/jarGuide.html)
   - [How to run a JAR file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5774970/run-jar-file-in-command-prompt).

<br>

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your DocTrack application. 
   - The DocTrack application will create a `data` folder in this _home folder_ to store your [data files](#faq).

<br>

4. Open a [command terminal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line) of your preference, and run the commands:
    ```
    cd HOME_FOLDER
    java -jar DocTrack.jar
   ```
    **_Example:_** if you copied `DocTrack.jar` into the folder `C:/Users/user/Documents`,
    run the commands:
    ```
   cd C:/Users/user/Documents
   java -jar DocTrack.jar
   ```

<br>

5. A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the DocTrack application contains some sample data.
   <br>
   ![Ui](images/Updated_UI.png)

<br>

6. Type the command in the command box, which is indicated by `Enter command here...`. Press `Enter` to execute it.<br>
   _**Example:** Typing **`help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window._<br>
   
   Some other examples of commands you can enter:
   * `list person` : Lists all contacts.
   * `add person n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 st/recovering` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
   * `delete person 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.
   * `clear person` : Deletes all contacts.
   * `exit` : Exits the app.

<br>

<box type="tip" light>

**Tip:**

This would be a good time to run the `clear person` command, to start afresh without sample data.

</box>

<br>

7. You can refer to the <a href="#command-overview" class="badge bg-primary">Command Overview</a> below for details of each command. 
    * You can also go to the specific subsections:
   <a href="#person-commands" class="badge bg-dark">Person commands</a>
    <a href="#appointment-commands" class="badge bg-dark">Appointment commands</a>
    <a href="#general-commands" class="badge bg-dark">General commands</a>

## **Interacting with DocTrack**

All interactions with the DocTrack platform are done through a series of **commands** 
(explained in <a href="#command-overview" class="badge bg-primary">Command Overview</a>) entered by you. 
- These commands allow you to perform various **tasks**, such as adding, editing, listing, deleting, finding,
and clearing persons/appointments. 
- The commands are designed to be flexible and user-friendly. 
  - You can add fields in any order.
  - You can add multiple entries for specific fields.

<box type="tip" light>

Here are some **key points** to keep in mind when you are using the commands:

- You should supply **all** the fields (words in **`UPPER_CASE`**) that are needed for a command.<br>
  _**Example:** In `add person n/NAME`, **`NAME`** is a field which can be used as `add person n/John Doe`._

- The **`INDEX`** in command formats like `edit person INDEX` and `delete appt INDEX` refers to the index 
  number (shown beside the person or appointment) in the displayed list. The index **must be a positive integer i.e. 1, 2, 3...** <br>
  _**Example:** The index of the first person displayed at the top the list is `1`, the index of the second person displayed is `2`, and so on._

- Items in **square** brackets **`[]`** are **optional**. <br>
  _**Example:** `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`._

- Items with `…​` after them can be used **zero times or more times**. <br>
  _**Example:**`[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc._

- You can add fields in **any order**. <br>
  _**Example:** If the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, then `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable._

<box type="tip" theme="success" light style="border: 1px solid">

**Tip:** 

If you add extraneous fields for commands that do not take in fields (such as `help`, `list person`, 
`list appt`, `exit` and `clear`), they will be ignored. <br>
_**Example:** If the command specifies `help 123`, then it will be interpreted as `help`._

</box>

<box type="warning" light style="border: 1px solid red">

**Caution:**

If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines. This is because some space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over.

You can identify these patients uniquely by their **patient ID (PID)** for easy reference. 

<br>

 You can also manage the patient information through different commands, which can be seen in the table below:

##### Editing a person : `edit person`

Edits an existing patient in DocTrack.

**Format**: `edit person INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [st/STATUS] [t/TAG]…​`

- Edits the patient at the specified `INDEX`.
- At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
- Existing values will be updated to the input values.
- When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
- You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.

**Examples**:

- `list` followed by `edit person 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email 
  address of the first person in the list to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
- `list` followed by `edit person 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` edits the name of the second person in the list to

<box type="warning" light>

**Caution:**

- If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, DocTrack will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended that you have a backup of the file before 
  editing it.<br>
- Furthermore, certain edits can cause DocTrack to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, you should edit the data file only if you are confident that you 
  can update it correctly.

## **FAQ**

**Q**: How is my data stored?<br>
**A**: Your data is stored in [.json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files, located in the `data` folder. The details of patients are stored in the `addressbook.json` file, 
while the appointments are stored in the `appointmentbook.json` file.

Examples:

An example of how the persons are stored:

```json
{
  "persons": [
    {
      "personId": 0,
      "name": "Alex Yeoh",
      "phone": "87438807",
      "email": "alexyeoh@example.com",
      "address": "Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40",
      "status": "Recovering",
      "tags": [
        "friends"
      ]
    },
    {
      "personId": 1,
      "name": "Bernice Yu",
      "phone": "99272758",
      "email": "berniceyu@example.com",
      "address": "Blk 30 Lorong 3 Serangoon Gardens, #07-18",
      "status": "Stable",
      "tags": [
        "colleagues",
        "friends"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

An example of how the appointments are stored:

```json
{
  "appointments": [
    {
      "appointmentId": 0,
      "appointmentType": "Consultation",
      "appointmentDateTime": "2024-10-20T09:30",
      "personId": 0,
      "sickness": "Flu",
      "medicine": "Antiviral"
    },
    {
      "appointmentId": 1,
      "appointmentType": "Follow-up",
      "appointmentDateTime": "2024-10-22T14:00",
      "personId": 1,
      "sickness": "Diabetes",
      "medicine": "Insulin"
    }
  ]
}
```
<br><br>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data (in the `addressbook.json` and `appointmentbook.json` files) to another 
computer?<br>
**A**: 
1. Save the `addressbook.json` and `appointmentbook.json` files from the `data` folder in your current computer.
2. [Install the DocTrack app](#quick-start) in the other computer. 
3. When you run DocTrack, it creates empty [.json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) files in the `data` 
   folder. 
4. Replace these empty files with the `addressbook.json` and `appointmentbook.json` files you saved from your previous computer.

<br>

**Q**: Can I access DocTrack without internet connection?<br>
**A**: Yes, You can run DocTrack without an internet connection.

<br>

**Q**: How do I back up my data?<br>
**A**: Since the data is saved in the `addressbook.json` and `appointmentbook.json` files in the `data` 
folder, you can copy these files to another location as a backup.

## **Known issues**

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

<br>

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

<br>

3. On **MacOS systems**, the bold fonts may appear slightly clipped.
