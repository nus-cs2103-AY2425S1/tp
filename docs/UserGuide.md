# KnottyPlanners üíçüéÄ

KnottyPlanners is a **desktop app for wedding planners, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Especially if you are a wedding planner who can type fast, KnottyPlanners can make organising multiple weddings at once a walk in the park! üå≥ 

If you are a technical user experienced with CLI feel free to jump right into [quick start for technical users!](#quick-start-technical-users). If it's your first time, don't panic; we will walk you through it in this User Guide! üòä

### What is Command Line Interface? ü§î
Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to type text commands to perform specific tasks quickly and efficiently on a computer. For example, type `list` in the interface and press enter; the user interface will show you all the contacts you have! Simple, right? Don't worry if you are still unsure about CLI, it's very easy to pick it up! üòÅ

### Why use Command Line Interface? 
* **Efficiency:** Perform tasks faster by replacing multiple mouse clicks into a single line of text ‚úÖ
* **Precision:** Avoid mis-clicking and mistakes as the CLI will execute the exact command you type üíØ
* **Offline:** CLI does not require internet and allows you to use it anywhere üë©‚Äçüíª

**IMPORTANT:**

**Delete and clear operations in KnottyPlanners:**

All delete and clear operations (except `tag-del`) in KnottyPlanners will be followed by a confirmation prompt to avoid accidental deletion. Therefore, delete and clear operations must be followed by either the `y` command (confirm delete operation) or the `n` command (remove pending operation). Otherwise, the previous operation will remain pending and following delete and clear commands may be affected. Hence, if you accidentally mistype or enter an unintended command before confirming, we suggest that you use `n` to cancel any pending delete operations to ensure everything runs smoothly. üòä

**TAKE NOTE:** `Y` and `N` will be considered as invalid commands as they are NOT the same as `y` and `n` respectively.

### Parameter Constraints
The table below provides a brief explanation of each parameter encountered in the command summary above. It also details the constraints of each parameter used in a command.

<box type="important" seamless>

**IMPORTANT:** 
* Please ensure that all parameters adhere to the constraints mentioned below. If you choose not to do so, the command will not be executed and error messages will be shown.
* KnottyPlanners does not accept any empty parameters, hence, please add in a placeholder value that you choose to replace an empty input with (e.g. `p/000` or `a/nil`).

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Autoformatting in KnottyPlanners:**<br>

* KnottyPlanners aligns with industry standards by automatically formatting the `NAME`, `JOB`, `TAG` and `WEDDING NAME` fields.
* All other fields that are not mentioned above are not formatted and will be saved based on your user input.

* For each field:
    - The first letter of each word is auto-capitalised.
    - Leading and trailing spaces are trimmed.
    - Extra spaces in between words are trimmed to 1 space.

* Examples:
    - `li sirui` is formatted to `Li Sirui` to ensure consistency in the name format.
    - `Wedding¬†¬†¬†Photographer¬†¬†` is formatted to `Wedding Photographer` to ensure consistency in the job names.
    - `Adam¬†¬†¬†&¬†Harry¬†` is formatted to `Adam & Harry` to ensure consistency in the wedding names.


**Duplication Detection in KnottyPlanners:**

This section details what constitutes as a duplicate in KnottyPlanners.
KnottyPlanners uses names to distinguish contacts from one another. However, due to autoformatting, duplicates may not be exact matches and therefore, may not be immediately obvious to you, the user.
Each parameter is followed by examples that explains if the input is considered a duplicate in KnottyPlanners.

`NAME`
* `Jeremy Ng` is equivalent to `JEREMY NG`, `Jeremy¬†¬†¬†¬†Ng` and `jeremy ng`.
* `Jeremy Ng` is NOT the same as `Jeremy Lin`.

`JOB`
* `Head Chef` is equivalent to `HEAD CHEF`, `Head¬†¬†¬†¬†Chef`</pre> and `head chef`.
* `Head Chef` is NOT the same as `Head Waiter`.

`TAG` and `WEDDING NAME`
* `John Stones & Mary Jane` is equivalent to `JOHN STONES & MARY JANE`, `John¬†¬†¬†¬†Stones &¬†¬†¬†¬†Mary Jane`</pre> and `john stones & mary jane`.
* `John Stones & Mary Jane` is NOT the same as `Mary Jane & John Stones`.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Important notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Ensure that an empty space ` `&nbsp;comes before each prefix. This will prevent your inputs from being misinterpreted by KnottyPlanners.<br>
  e.g. `edit n/john a/woodlandsj/job` will not be interpreted correctly. Rectify this by typing in `edit n/john a/woodlands j/job`.

* Tags in KnottyPlanners are used exclusively to tag person to wedding, hence both wedding name and tag names should be 2 person names separated with a & (e.g. `John Loh & Jean Tan`, `Stacy & Sam`).

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†`&nbsp;(i.e. 0 times), `John Loh & Jean Tan`, `Stacy & Sam` etc.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `list-wed`, `exit`, `clear-ab` and `clear-wb`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Prefixes refer to the identifier before the parameter e.g. `n/` before `NAME`. Invalid prefixes (i.e. prefixes that do not exist) will be ignored.<br>
e.g. if the command specifies `tag-add n/John Doe b/juice t/John Loh & Jean Tan`, it will be interpreted as `tag-add n/John Doe t/John Loh & Jean Tan`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as whitespace characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
  </box>

### Viewing Help: `help`

You can view a popup with an overview of all the commands, and a link to this user guide if you need more details.

Format: `help`

![help message](images/helpmsg.png)

### Adding a Contact: `add`

You can add a person to the list of contacts.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS j/JOB [t/TAG]`

* A person can have any number of tags (including 0). Tags are associated to the weddings this person is
  involved in. The wedding must already exist in the wedding book to successfully tag a person to it.

<box type="important" seamless>

**IMPORTANT:**

* If you are worried about adding duplicated people, fret not! KnottyPlanners will alert you when an identical person is added.
* If you add tags of a weddings that does not exist, KnottyPlanners will still add the person and ignore invalid tags.
* We will also alert you when you add a different person with the same name and you can add in keywords in these situations to differentiate them üòä (e.g. if `John` is duplicated, you can consider changing into `John Tan` or `John from school`).    

</box>

![add message](images/addMsg.png)

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, Blk 123, #01-04 j/Photographer`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe p/90341259 e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Center j/Caterer t/Stacy & Sam` P.S. The wedding `Stacy & Sam` must be created first using `add-wed` command!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting a Contact: `del` followed by `y` or `n`

You can delete a person from your list of contacts.

Format: `del n/NAME` followed by `y` or `n`

* Deletes the person with the specified `NAME` from the address book.
* The contact's details are shown for confirmation.
* The contact is deleted if `y` is entered.
* The contact is not deleted if `n` is entered, cancelling the delete operation and nothing will occur.

<box type="important" seamless>

**IMPORTANT:** 
* `del n/NAME` MUST BE followed by either of the two commands, otherwise, following delete commands may be affected. Refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary) for more information. üòä

### Editing a Contact: `edit`

You can edit an existing contact's details (name, phone number, email, address and job).

Format: `edit n/NAME [new/NEW_NAME] [p/NEW_PHONE] [e/NEW_EMAIL] [a/NEW_ADDRESS] [j/NEW_JOB]`

* You have to provide at least one of the optional fields.
* Tags can't be edited, so if you'd like to change a tag, simply delete the existing one using
['tag-del'](#adding-tag-s-to-a-contact-tag-add-ta) and add a new one using ['tag-add'](#deleting-tag-s-from-a-contact-tag-del-td)!

<box type="important" seamless>

**IMPORTANT:**
* Multiple inputs of the same parameter can be added but only the last one will be accepted.
* Examples:
  - `edit n/John p/111 p/222` will edit John's phone number to `222` (the first phone number will be ignored).
  - `edit n/John n/Gary a/Tampines Heights` will edit Gary's address to `Tampines Heights` (John's address will remain unedited).
* Order of parameters does not matter and the person to edit will depend on the `n/NAME`.
* Examples:
  - `edit p/222 n/John` will edit John's phone number to `222`.
  - `edit a/Tampines Heights p/123 n/John` will edit John's address to `Tampines Heights` and John's phone number to `123` respectively.
* Editing a field with the original value will be considered a valid command.
  - `edit n/John new/John` is a valid command and no changes will be made, same applies to other fields.
  - `edit n/John new/john` or `edit n/John new/   john` is a valid command and no changes will be made as names are auto-formatted to 'John' in KnottyPlanners.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimise the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimised, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimised Help Window.
3. **Edit commands** can have multiple inputs of the same parameter but only the last input will be accepted (e.g. `edit n/John p/111 p/222` the edited phone number will become `222`).
