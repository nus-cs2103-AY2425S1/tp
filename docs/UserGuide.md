ContactMate is a **desktop app for managing clients (Singaporeans and Permanent Residents) of the Befriending Program at Active Ageing Centres (AACs), optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ContactMate can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the commands:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets `[]` are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/fallrisk` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/wheelchairUser`, `t/wheelchairUser` `t/livingAlone` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* The `personList` view is the view where the list of elderly is shown. It is the default view when you start the application. Use the `list` command to return to this view if you are in another view.

* The fields in a command cannot contain whitespace followed by any of the command's prefix as part of the input. For example, `address` cannot be `a/Clementi Ave a/2` but can be `a/Clementi Area/2`. Another example is `notes` can neither be `o/This is a note o/part of same note` nor `o/Note with d/in it` but can be `o/I asked a no/yes question`.

* The fields in a command are displayed exactly as they are in the command (no change of case). For example, if using `n/john doe` in a valid `add` command, it is displayed as `john doe` and not as `John Doe`. Similarly, if using `i/s8645190e` in a valid `add` command, it is displayed as `s8645190e` and not as `S8645190E`.

</div>

### Marking an elderly : `mark`

You can also mark the specified elderly as called on a specific date and add notes.
It is allowed to mark the same elderly multiple times on the same day.

Format: `mark INDEX/NRIC [d/DATE] [o/NOTES]`

* Marks the elderly at the specified `INDEX` or `NRIC`.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. It must be a **positive integer** (e.g., 1, 2, 3, …​) and fall within the range of the list shown.
* The `NRIC` used to select the elderly to mark must be a valid, government issued NRIC and must be shown in the displayed person list.
* The date must be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` and must not be a future date.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:bangbang: **Warning:**
This command is irreversible. Use with caution.
</div>

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Navigating the Command History
You are able to navigate through your command history (both valid and invalid commands) by using the up <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> and down <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> arrow keys. Before using the arrow keys, ensure that the command box is already in focus (if you are unsure, click on the command box to refocus on it).

### Duplicate detection
Duplicate entries (elderly) are entries with the same NRIC (case-insensitive). ContactMate will not allow duplicate entries, and will stop you from adding (`add`) or editing (`edit`) an elderly if it would result in a duplicate entry.

Examples:
* `edit 1 i/S2208201I` followed by `edit 2 i/s2208201i` will result in an error message, as the NRIC `S2208201I` already exists.

A weaker notion of duplication is that of entries with the same name, phone number or email (all case-insensitive). ContactMate will not prevent you from adding (`add`) or editing (`edit`) an elderly in this case, but will warn you that the entry is a potential duplicate.

Examples:
* `edit 1 n/John Doe` followed by `edit 2 n/John Doe` will result in a warning message, as the name `John Doe` already exists, but the edit will still be allowed.

### Saving the data

ContactMate data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

ContactMate data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/contactmate.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ContactMate will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause ContactMate to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous ContactMate home folder.

**Q**: Why can't I execute certain commands like `mark S2208201I` when the displayed person list is empty after a `find` command?<br>
**A**: Commands that refer to an elderly by index or NRIC will not work if the elderly is not shown in the displayed person list view. To execute these commands, you can use the `list` command to return to the full, unfiltered displayed person list view.

**Q**: Why are the `delete`, `edit` and `mark` commands are restricted in the history list view?<br>
**A**: These commands are restricted in the history list view to prevent unintended modifications to an elder's details. To modify an elderly's information accurately, you can use the `list` command to return to the person list view. 

**Q**: Why can't I `mark S2208201I` when I am currently viewing the contact records of the elderly with NRIC `S2208201I`? <br>
**A**: The `mark` command requires you to be in the person list view rather in the individual history list view. It ensures that all-elderly related commands function as expected and to avoid confusion. 

**Q**: How do I save my data?<br>
**A**: ContactMate ensures your data is saved automatically after every command.

**Q**: They keep saying that the NRIC is invalid. What should I do?<br>
**A**: ContactMate uses an algorithm to check the validity of the NRIC. Please ensure that you have not typed any digit or character wrongly. Otherwise, confirm with the elderly that they have given you the correct NRIC. 

**Q**: Why can't I add an elderly with an NRIC starting with `M`?<br>
**A**: Please check if you have the correct NRIC. NRICs starting with `M` are only issued to foreigners and are not valid for the Singaporeans and Permanent Residents in the Befriending Program.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
