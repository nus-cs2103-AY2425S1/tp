## 4. Tutorial: Getting Started with PlanPal


This tutorial guides you step-by-step to use the key features of PlanPal effectively. 
If there are any commands that you do not understand, refer to the [Features](#5-features) section below for more details.


### 4.1 Adding Contacts

Contacts are the heart of PlanPal, so let's start by adding one.
Imagine you’re organising a university festival, and Jeff Tan is your first attendee. 
Here's how you can add Jeff to your contact list:

1. Open PlanPal.
2. Type the `add` command in the command box and press Enter.

**Command Format:** `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TELEGRAM_USERNAME] [r/ROLE]…`

**Example:**
`add n/Jeff Tan p/98114507 e/jeff@example.com a/Blk 12 Geylang Street 5, #06-40 r/attendee t/jeffyt`

Great! You’ve just added Jeff Tan as an attendee. You can see his details appear in the contact list. 
Feel free to experiment by adding more contacts for vendors, sponsors, or other attendees. 
Remember, you can assign roles like `attendee`, `sponsor`, `vendor`, and `volunteer` to keep things organised.
Now try and adding a contact with your own details! Once you have done so, let's move onto the next step!

### 4.2 Deleting Contacts

Uh oh, Olivia Ong has just informed you that she is no longer going to be attending the event.
Find what her index number is and delete her from the contacts!

1. Find the contact you want to delete.
2. Use the `delete` command with the contact's **INDEX** as displayed in the list.

**Command Format:** `delete INDEX`

**Example:** `delete 1`

Poof! Olivia is now removed from the list. 
Don’t worry—you can always re-add them later.

### 4.3 Adding Events

Now that your contact list is taking shape, let’s organize them into events. 
Picture this: You’re planning a “Summer Orientation,” and you want to track everyone involved.
To create the event, you need to follow the following format type:

**Command Format:** `new EVENT_NAME`

**Example:** `new Summer Orientation`

Congratulations! Your event “Summer Orientation” is now added to the event list.
You can repeat this process for other events like “Tech Symposium” or other events.
Remember to use descriptive, but succinct, names so you can easily identify your events.

### 4.4 Adding Contacts to Events

What’s an event without people? Let’s add some contacts to your new event.
But before we do that, we need to find the people to add into your contact. 
Searching for them manually is much harder with hundreds of contacts, which 
is why you can search for them by name! Let's look for Jeff Tan again using the 
`find-name` command. 

**Command Format:** `find-name NAME`

**Example:** `find-name Jeff`

Now you can add Jeff to your event! Let's add him to the "Summer Orientation" using the
`event-add` command. In the event of multiple people with the name of Jeff, make sure you
select the one you want carefully!

To add contacts to an event, use the `event-add` command. 
You can specify the event index, contact indices, and the role of the contact in the event.
Because of our previous search of finding Jeff by name, he should be at the top!

**Command Format:** `event-add ei/EVENT_INDEX <a/ or s/ or ve/ or vo/>CONTACT_INDEX [MORE_CONTACT_INDICES]...`

**Example:** `event-add ei/3 a/1`

This command would add Jeff to the list of attendees of the Summer Orientation event.
Do note that Jeff needs to have a role before he can be added to an event!

**Roles:**
- `a/` – Attendee
- `s/` – Sponsor
- `ve/` – Vendor
- `vo/` – Volunteer


_While not required to complete to tutorial, 
if you are curious about the strange bracket notations click [Features](#5-features) to read more about the command formats!_


### 4.5 Using Search Mode

Now imagine your contact list has grown significantly,
and you need a faster way to filter and manage contacts.
That’s where Search Mode comes in! It allows you to perform advanced searches
using multiple criteria, helping you find exactly who you’re looking for.

To activate Search Mode, follow these steps:

1. Open PlanPal and type the following command to enter Search Mode:
   
**Command Format:** `search-mode`

**Example:** `search-mode`

Once activated, you’ll notice the interface changes to display all contacts in PlanPal.
Let’s move on to filtering these contacts!

### 4.6 Searching for Contacts

Let’s say you want to find attendees with a specific name or role.
Search Mode makes this easy! Imagine you need to find all contacts named “Alex” who
are attendees.

1. In Search Mode, type the following command:
   
**Command Format:** `search <n/NAME r/ROLE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS p/PHONE t/TELEGRAM_USERNAME>`

   **Example:** `search n/Alex r/attendee`

This will filter the list to show only those contacts named “Alex” with the role “attendee.” PlanPal will display these filtered results in the center panel. If the list still feels too broad, you can add more criteria to narrow it down further.

Now try searching for someone from your own contact list!



### 4.7 Excluding Contacts from Search Results

Sometimes, you might want to exclude certain contacts from your results to refine your search even more.
Try the following command which will result in search finding all contacts that have "Co" in their name:
1. `search n/Co`
2. Use the `exclude` command to remove unwanted contacts from the results:
   
**Command Format:** `exclude ci/INDEX [MORE_INDICES]`

**Example:** `exclude ci/2`

This will exclude the contact at index 2 from your search results. 
Excluded contacts won’t appear in future searches until you clear the excluded list. Perfect for filtering down to exactly what you need!

### 4.8 Viewing and Clearing Excluded Contacts

Now that you’ve excluded a contact, you might want to review or reset your excluded list.

1. To view all excluded contacts, type:
   
**Command Format:** `check-excluded`

**Example:** `check-excluded`

2. To clear the excluded list and start fresh, use:
   
**Command Format:** `clear-excluded`

**Example:** `clear-excluded`

Once cleared, the excluded contacts will reappear in search results,
ready to be filtered again. Go ahead and give it a try!

### 4.9 Adding All Filtered Contacts to an Event

After refining your search, you might want to add all filtered contacts to an event.
Let’s say you’ve filtered a group of attendees for the “Summer Orientation” event.

1. Use the `add-all` command to add them to the event:
   
**Command Format:** `add-all EVENT_INDEX`

**Example:** `add-all 3`

This command adds all currently displayed contacts in your search results to the
event with index 3. It’s a huge time-saver for managing large groups of attendees,
sponsors, or vendors.

### 4.10 Exiting Search Mode

Once you’ve completed your searches and added contacts to events, you can exit
Search Mode and return to the normal interface.

1. To exit Search Mode, type:
   
**Command Format:** `exit-search`

**Example:** `exit-search`

You’re back to the default view of your contact list, ready to tackle other tasks.
Don’t forget—you can always re-enter Search Mode whenever you need it.

If you want to erase all the default contacts, simply type `clear`.

Now that you’ve mastered Search Mode, you’re equipped to handle even the
largest contact lists with ease. Onward to managing events like a pro!

#### 5.4.1 Searching in Search-mode `search`

Format: `search <n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS t/TELEGRAM_USERNAME r/ROLE…​>`

* The search is case-insensitive (e.g., `BLK` matches `blk`).
* For each field (e.g. name, phone number, email), you can specify multiple keywords.

With one Field:
- Contacts whose field contains a word that fully matches **at least one** keyword will be returned OR Contacts whose field
  contains **all** the keywords will be returned.<br>

Example:
* `search n/John` returns `John` and `John Doe`.
* `search a/Jurong East` returns `Jurong West` and `Tampines East`.<br>
* `search p/123 456` will return `123`, `456` and `123456`.

With Multiple Fields:
- Contacts will be returned only if they match **all** specified fields.

Example:
- `search n/Samuel Tan a/Avenue` returns all contacts whose:
    - name has words either `Samuel` or `Tan` **OR** contains `Samuel` **AND** `Tan`. 
    - **AND** address contains `Avenue`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:memo: **Note:**
A flag parameter should not be empty (e.g. `n/` or `t/`), as it will not return any results.
Flag parameters should also not be repeated (e.g. `n/Alex n/John`).
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can chain multiple searches to get the full list of contacts you are looking for!
If you are looking for a specific contact, try to be as specific as possible to get the best results!
</div>

#### 5.4.2 Excluding Contacts in Search Mode : `exclude`
Exclude contacts from the search results.

Format: `exclude ci/INDEX, [MORE_INDICES]...`

* `INDEX` refers to the contact index displayed in the search results panel.
* Excluded contacts will not appear in any subsequent searches until they are cleared from the excluded list.

Example:
- `search n/John` returns a list of contacts named `John`. 
<br>
  ![FeaturesSearchModeJohn.png](images%2FAppImages%2FFeaturesSearchModeJohn.png)
- `exclude ci/2` excludes the second contact from the search results. <br>
  ![FeaturesSearchModeExclude.png](images%2FAppImages%2FFeaturesSearchModeExclude.png) <br>
- Subsequent searches will not include the excluded contact.
    - `search p/9234512` will match the previously excluded contact but will not reappear in the results.
    <br>

#### 5.4.3 Viewing Excluded Contacts : `check-excluded` or `chx`
To view the contacts currently excluded from search results, use the `check-excluded` command.

Format: `check-excluded`

Example:
- `check-excluded` displays the list of excluded contacts. <br>
  ![FeaturesSearchModeCheckExcluded.png](images%2FAppImages%2FFeaturesSearchModeCheckExcluded.png)

#### 5.4.4 Clearing Excluded Contacts : `clear-excluded` or `clx`
To remove all contacts from the excluded list, use the `clear-excluded` command. Excluded contacts will then
appear in search results again.

Format: `clear-excluded`

Example:
![FeaturesSearchModeClearExcluded.png](images%2FAppImages%2FFeaturesSearchModeClearExcluded.png)

#### 5.4.5 Adding All Selected Contacts to an Event : `add-all` or `aa`
To add all selected contacts in Search Mode to an event, use the `add-all` command.

Format: `add-all EVENT_INDEX`

* Contacts will be added to the event for each of their roles. (e.g., if John is both a sponsor and a vendor, he will be added to Event X in both roles).
* Contacts with no roles cannot be added to events
* There needs to be at least one contact in the search results panel to add to the event.
* The `EVENT_INDEX` refers to the number shown in the displayed events list and **must be a positive integer**.

Example: `add-all 2`

#### 5.4.6 Exiting Search Mode : `exit-search` or `es`
To exit Search Mode and return to the normal display, use the `exit-search` or `es` command.

Format: `exit-search` or `es`

_This concludes the commands available in Search Mode. The following commands can be used in the normal display mode._

### 5.5 Clearing All Entries : `clear`

Removes all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### 5.6 Exiting the Program : `exit`

Closes the program. Typing `exit` in search mode will close the program as well.

Format: `exit`

### 5.7 Saving Data

PlanPal data is saved automatically to your hard disk after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### 5.8 Editing the Data File

PlanPal data is stored as 2 JSON files in `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json` and `[JAR file location]/data/eventmanager.json`. 
While it is possible to edit these files to manually insert data, Planpal has various processes to handle parsing the data and invalid data may lead to unexpected behaviour. 
We **do not** recommend editing the storage `.json` files directly, unless you are familiar with the JSON format and PlanPal's data structure.

### 5.9 Navigating Through Command History

Use the `up` and `down` arrow keys to navigate through your command history. Pressing the up arrow displays previously executed commands, allowing you to re-run or edit past commands without retyping them. The down arrow moves forward through the command history, returning to more recent commands.

## 6. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and replace the empty data file it creates with the file containing the data from your previous PlanPal home folder.

**Q**: What should I do if the program isn’t launching correctly?<br>
**A**: First, ensure you have Java 17 or above installed. If you do, try re-downloading the `.jar` file and running it again. If issues persist, check your system’s permissions for accessing and running files.

**Q**: Can I customize the data file's storage location?<br>
**A**: The data file is saved automatically in `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. While you cannot change this location within the application, you can move the entire PlanPal folder to a different location. Make sure to update any shortcuts or file paths accordingly.

**Q**: How can I restore accidentally deleted contacts?<br>
**A**: If you recently deleted contacts, the data is permanently removed from PlanPal. We recommend keeping regular backups of your data file to restore information if needed.

**Q**: Why does the GUI open off-screen when I switch monitors?<br>
**A**: This can happen when switching between multiple monitors. To fix this, delete the `preferences.json` file, which stores display settings, and restart PlanPal.

## 7. Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**: If you move the application to a secondary screen and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI may open off-screen. **Solution**: Delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running it again.

2. **Minimized Help Window Issue**: If you minimize the Help Window and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the `F1` shortcut) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. **Solution**: Manually restore the minimized Help Window from your taskbar.
