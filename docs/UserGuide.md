## Glossary

| Term                                  | Definition                                                                                                                                                                        |

| **Command Line Interface (CLI)**      | A text-based user interface that allows users to type commands to perform specific tasks, rather than using graphical elements like buttons.                                      |
| **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**    | A visual interface that includes graphical elements (such as windows, icons, and buttons) for users to interact with applications.                                                |
| **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** | A lightweight data-interchange format often used for data storage and communication between applications. TechConnect saves data in JSON format for easy access and modification. |
| **Parameter**                         | Information or input provided to a command to specify how it should operate. For example, in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter that specifies the company name to add.          |
| **Jar File (.jar)**                   | A Java Archive file, which is a package file format used to distribute Java applications. Running the `.jar` file will start the TechConnect application.                         |

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed on your computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for TechConnect.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar techconnect.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note that the app contains some sample data.<br>

### Special Tag Values

When using the `add` command, certain **tags** have special values.
Each Company can only have 1 tag for each type (e.g. can't have 2 Salary Tags). If duplicate tag types are provided,

Below are the supported categories:

##### 1. Salary, Work-Life Balance, and Interview Difficulty Tags

These tags represent qualitative levels. The valid VALUES for these tags are:

- **Low**
- **Medium**
- **High**

These tags must be written using the following format (note the underscore):

- Salary tag: `t/salary_VALUE`
- Difficulty tag: `t/difficulty_VALUE`
- Work-Life Balance tag: `t/wlb_VALUE`

**Note:** Any additional underscores or characters after the given format,
like in `t/salary_VALUE_extra`, `_extra` will be ignored.

**Example:**

```
add n/Google p/98765432 e/google@example.com a/John street, block 123,
#01-01 cp/www.google-career-url.com r/ t/salary_high t/wlb_medium t/difficulty_medium

```

**Outcome**:

<img src="images/TagCommandOutcome3.png" alt="Tag Command Outcome 3">

##### **Unsupported and Invalid Tag values**

- Only alphanumeric characters are allowed in the tag
- If you attempt to create tags with values that aren't in the supported list given above, the tag will appear
  with whatever value you input. Example `t/helloworld` creates a tag called "helloworld".

Other Invalid tag example:

- Trying to create a tag like `t/mytag_high` or `t/mytag high` will fail as we will treat your tag value
  as `mytag_high` and `mytag high` and the underscore/spacing is not a alphanumeric character

### Saving the data

TechConnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

[Back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)

---

### Editing the data file

TechConnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, TechConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the TechConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**A**: TechConnect is able to run on Windows, macOS and Linux environments. Please ensure that you have `Java 17` installed as stated in [Quick Start](#quick-start).

**Q**: Why is there data when I did not add any data when I launched the application?<br>
**A**: The data in TechConnect is sample data that already exists. The purpose is to allow users to try out the features of TechConnect based on sample data. To work on a fresh copy, simply use the `clear` command.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TechConnect home folder.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen.

- The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear.

- The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
