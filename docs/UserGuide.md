## Quick start

Let's get you started with VolunSync! Just follow these simple steps:

1. **Check if you have Java**
   First, let's make sure your computer has Java **17** or newer:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
     - On Windows: Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and hit Enter.
     - On Mac/Linux: Open the Terminal from your Applications.
       ```bash
       java -version
       ```
   - If you see a version like `java version "17.x.x"` or higher, you're all set!
   - If Java is not installed or the version is lower than 17:
      - Download and install the latest Java Development Kit (JDK) **17** from [Oracle's official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/).
      - Follow the installation instructions provided for your operating system.
   - After installation, re-run `java -version` to confirm the setup.

1. **Download VolunSync**
   - Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/releases).
   - Put the downloaded file in any folder where you'd like to keep VolunSync

3. **Start VolunSync**
    - Open your computer's command window
    - Type `cd` followed by the location of your VolunSync application (e.g. `C:/Users/Your_Name/Your_Folder`)
    - Type `java -jar` and the name of the file (like `java -jar volunsync-v1.5.jar`) into the terminal or command prompt and hit `Enter`.

4. **You're Ready!**
   - When you see this window, you're all set to begin:
![Ui](images/VolunSyncUi.png)

5. **Try It Out**
    Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.<br>
     Some example commands you can try:

    * `list` : Lists all volunteers and events in the VolunSync database.

    * `/v new n/John Doe p/91234567 em/john@gmail.com d/2024-02-02` : Creates a new record for a volunteer named `John Doe` to the VolunSync database.

    * `/v del 3` : Deletes the third volunteer on the list of volunteers.

    * `/e new n/Food collection l/NTUC d/2024-11-29 s/00:00 e/23:59 des/Collecting unsold food from NTUC for distribution` : Creates a new record for an event named `Food collection` to the VolunSync database.

## Command Format Guidelines

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Helpful Tips for Using Commands:**

Let's go over some simple guidelines that will help you use VolunSync easily:

* When you see `UPPERCASE` words, that's where you'll put your own information.
  For example, in `n/NAME`, you might type `n/John Doe`

* Don't worry about the order! If a command asks for `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, you can type them in any order:
  `p/91234567 n/John Doe` works just as well

* Square brackets `[ ]` mean optional items.
  For example, in an event description [des/DESCRIPTION], you can skip it if you don't need it

* No need to worry about extra spaces at the start or end of your typing - VolunSync handles that for you

* When counting characters (like for names or descriptions), spaces count too:
<pre> "AB"   = 2 characters
 "A B"  = 3 characters
 "A  B" = 4 characters
</pre>

* Simple commands like `help` will work even if you accidentally type extra things after them
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* When copying multi-line commands from this guide, make sure the spaces between lines remain intact, especially if you're using a PDF version.

* INDEX parameters accept a maximum positive value of `2147483647` any larger value would result in an invalid command format. It also has to be a positive value.

## General Commands

### Viewing help : `help`

Need a hand? Just type `help` to open this guide in your web browser for easy reference anytime.<br>
Alternatively you can click the help button at the top of the window or press the F1 key.

Format: `help`

![Showing Help](images/VolunSyncUiShowHelpButton.png)

[Back To Top :arrow_heading_up:](#learn-about-commands-supported-by-volunsync)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

![Ui](images/VolunSyncUi.png)

[Back To Top :arrow_heading_up:](#learn-about-commands-supported-by-volunsync)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Export database to a CSV file : `export`

Exports all records within the database to a Comma Separated Value (.csv) file. This allows you to print the records or transfer the data to another computer for external use. Note that the **import function is not yet implemented**, so exported files cannot be directly re-imported into VolunSync at this time.

Format : `export`

1. Look for a folder called `/output` in the folder where you keep VolunSync
2. You'll find two files:
    - `events.csv` - Contains all your event information
    - `volunteers.csv` - Contains all your volunteer information

![Export File](images/ExportCommand.png)

[Back To Top :arrow_heading_up:](#learn-about-commands-supported-by-volunsync)

### Closing the program : `exit`

Ready to finish up? Just type `exit` to close VolunSync safely.

Format: `exit`

## About Saving Your Work

Don't worry about saving - VolunSync automatically saves everything you do! Every change you make is safely stored on your computer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: Can I undo an action that I just made?<br>
**A**: Not yet, but we're working on adding an `undo` feature in our next update. Stay tuned!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known Issues

1. **Using Multiple Screens?**
   If you move VolunSync to a second screen and later disconnect it:

    - To fix this, just find and delete the `preferences.json` file
    - Start VolunSync again, and it'll open on your main screen

1. **Trying To Modify Data Files?**
   - **Don't** modify the data files in the `data` folder
   - Doing so may result in unexpected behaviour when using VolunSync, such as the app crashing
   - You may lose your data permanently

These known issues are actively being worked on, and we are continuously improving VolunSync to provide a better experience. Please stay tuned for future updates!
