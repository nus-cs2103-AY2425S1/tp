## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

* Commands are in lower-case.<br>
  e.g. `add` is allowed, while `Add` or `aDD` will not be recognised.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines
  as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* `find Betsy` followed by `delete S2345678E` deletes the patient with 'S2345678E' in the results of the `find` command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bangbang: **Warning:** <br>
Deletions only work if the displayed list contains the entry you are deleting. Hence, attempting to delete a record
by NRIC if the record is not currently displayed will not work.
 </div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Deleting a patient by Index:

Format: `clear`

![clear](images/clear.png)


### Listing all patients : `list`

Shows a list of all patients in ClinicBuddy.

Format: `list`

![list](images/list%20all%20patients.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


### Locating patients: `find`

`find` allows you to find patient records by NRIC or name.

#### Finding a single record by its NRIC

Format: `find NRIC`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `s1234567z` will match `S1234567Z`
* The **NRIC** must start with 'S', 'T', 'F','G' or 'M', have 7 digits, and end with a letter.
* In a single command, only one record with the given **NRIC** can be found. e.g. `find S1234567Z T7654321Z` does not work
  as it attempts to find 2 records containing the given NRICs.
* Only full **NRICs** will be matched e.g. `S12345` will not match `S1234567Z`

Example:

* `find S1234567Z` returns the patient record whose NRIC is `S1234567Z`

  ![result for 'find S1234567Z'](./images/findS1234567Zresult.png)


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


#### Finding multiple records by their names

Finds patient records whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched. e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Patients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Examples:

* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bangbang: **Warning:** <br>
If only one input is keyed in and it has an NRIC format (e.g S1234567Z), the find command will search for the patient 
with that NRIC rather than a patient with that name. The application assumes that single inputs of NRIC format are 
NRICs. When multiple keywords are used, the application treats the keywords as names, regardless of whether they
are in NRIC format or not.
 </div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding all patients with appointments on a specific date : `bookings`

Finds all patients with appointments on the specified date.

Format: `bookings DATE`

* Finds all patients with appointments on `DATE`
* `DATE` has to be of the format `dd/MM/yyyy` OR `dd-MM-yyyy` OR `dd MM yyyy`

Examples:
* `bookings 12/08/2024` finds all patients with appointments on 12 August 2024.
* `bookings 14-10-2024` finds all patients with appointments on 14 October 2024. 

  ![result for 'bookings 01/02/2024'](./images/bookings01-02-2024.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting an appointment : `deleteappt`

* `NRIC` refers to the unique identifier displayed in the current patient list.
* `NRIC` must start with 'S', 'T', 'F', 'G' or 'M', have 7 digits, and end with a letter.

Example:
* `deleteappt s1234567z 01-01-2024 12:12` deletes the appointment on January 1, 2024, for the patient identified by the NRIC S1234567Z, assuming 12:12 falls within his appointment window.

Format: `deleteappt INDEX DATE HH:mm` 

* Removes the appointment scheduled at the specified date and time for the patient at the given Index.
* `INDEX` refers to the patient’s position in the displayed list.
* `INDEX` must be a positive whole number no larger than the size of the list.

Example:

![hours](images/update%20operating%20hours.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Saving the data

ClinicBuddy data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to
save manually.

### Editing the data file

- ClinicBuddy data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/clinicbuddy.json`. 
- Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file. 
- If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ClinicBuddy will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. 
- Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.
- Furthermore, certain edits can cause ClinicBuddy to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). 
- Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Backup the records : `backup`

ClinicBuddy ensures the security and recovery of patient records through manual and automated backups.
These are useful to save the state of your current data at a specific point in time.

#### **Manual Backup: Save your current data**
- The `backup` command allows users to manually save a copy of their current patient records.

- Key Features:
  - **Description Option:** You can add a meaningful description to identify the backup.
  - **Indexed Backups:** Backup files are automatically assigned an index (`0`–`9`).
  - **Automated Deletion:** Only the latest 10 backups are retained to optimize storage.

- How Manual Backup Works:
  - **Basic Command:** Input `backup` to create a backup with a default description (`manual_backup`).
  - **Custom Description:** Use `backup DESCRIPTION` to label your backup with details about changes.
  - **File Location:** Backups are stored in `[Application Directory]/backups/`.
  - Each backup file is assigned a timestamp of the creation time and an index number.
  - The index will reset to `0` after reaching `9`, **overwriting** the oldest backup file.
  
- File Naming Format:
  * `INDEX_DESCRIPTION_TIMESTAMP.json`

- Example:
  * `3_After updating John's contact info_2024-10-30_15-45-00-000.json`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:warning:
**Important Notes:** <br>
- Use clear and unique descriptions to distinguish backup files. <br>
- A backup name is limited to 250 characters only.
 </div>

![manual_backup](images/manual_backup.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### **Automated Backup: Ensure data safety with minimal effort**
- ClinicBuddy automatically creates backups during critical operations:
    - **Before Deleting a Patient:** A backup is created before any record deletion.
    - **Before Clearing Patient Record:** A backup is generated when all patient data is cleared.

- How Automated Backup Works:
    - **Description Naming:** Backups are labeled with the action, such as `delete_<name>` or `clear`.
    - **No User Action Required:** These backups are generated automatically and stored in the same `/backups/` folder.
    - **Formatting:** Automated backups also follow the indexed system (`0`–`9`) and contain a timestamp of the creation time.
    
- Example:
    * `0_delete_John Doe_2024-10-30_18-05-29-745.json`
    * `1_clear_2024-10-30_18-05-29-745.json`

![automated_backup](images/automatedbackup.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Listing all backups : `listbackups`

Format: `listbackups`

#### How listbackups works:
- The `listbackups` command displays all saved backups, including their:
    - **Index:** Identifies each backup. 
    - **Description:** Explains the backup's purpose. 
    - **Timestamp:** Shows when the backup was created.
    - The backup list displayed will be sorted in descending by the timestamp.
- Example:
  ```
  Available backups:
  2 [delete_John Doe] Created on: 30 Nov 2024 18:05:29
  1 [manual_backup] Created on: 13 Jul 2024 09:52:10
  0 [clinicbuddy] Created on: 21 May 2024 13:20:07
  ```

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:warning:
**Important Note:** <br>
The date format used is dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss.
 </div>

![listbackups](images/listbackups.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Restoring data from backups : `restore`

The `restore` command allows users to revert to a previous backup file using its index. This feature is essential for recovering data after accidental changes or deletions.

Format: `restore INDEX`

#### How Restore Works:
- **View Available Backups:** Use the listbackups command to display all backup files. 
- **Restore Command:** Enter restore INDEX to restore the backup with the specified index. 
- Example:
  `restore 2` restores the backup from index 2.
  
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bangbang:
**Warnings:** <br>
- Restoring a backup overwrites all current patient records.<br>
- It is suggested to create a manual backup before restoring to preserve recent changes.<br>
 </div>

![restore](images/restore.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: What should I do if I accidentally delete a patient record? <br>
**A**: If a patient record is accidentally deleted, you can use the `restore` command to retrieve it from a backup file.

**Q**: Can I customize the operating hours of ClinicBuddy? <br>
**A**: Yes! You can use the `hours` command to set custom opening and closing times. Note that all existing appointments must fall within these new hours for the change to take effect.

**Q**: What happens if I update a patient’s information incorrectly? <br>
**A**: If an error occurs during an update, you can re-update the patient's details with the correct information. Alternatively, restoring data from a recent backup may help recover the previous details.  Ensure you have created regular backups to make this possible.

**Q**: How can I view a history of my backups? <br>
**A**: Use the `listbackups` command to see all available backups with timestamps. This feature can help you select the correct backup if you need to restore data.

**Q**: What happens if I enter incorrect or missing information in a command?<br>
**A**: ClinicBuddy will display an error message and prompt you to check the format or required fields. Double-check command formats and required parameters to avoid errors.

**Q**: What if I want to add a new field, such as a patient’s insurance information?<br>
**A**: ClinicBuddy’s current structure does not support custom fields. However, you can use the `tag` option to include additional details in a flexible way.

**Q**: What if I forget the command formats?<br>
**A**: You can use the `help` command in ClinicBuddy for a quick reference. Alternatively, you can refer back to this user guide. This guide includes command formats and examples to assist you.

**Q**: How are backups sorted in the `listbackups` command?<br>
**A**: Backups are listed in descending order by their creation timestamp, with the most recent backup appearing at the top.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Q**: Is there a limit on the number of backups I can store?<br>
**A**: Yes. ClinicBuddy retains only the 10 most recent backups for storage efficiency. Older backups are automatically overwritten when a new backup is created.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only
   the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the
   application before running the application again.

2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard
   shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy
   is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

3. ClinicBuddy has a **limit of storing only the 10 most recent backups**. Once this limit is reached, older backups are automatically overwritten. This means that only the latest 10 backups are available for restoring data. To avoid accidental loss of older backups, users should download or move older backup files if they need to retain them long-term.

4. ClinicBuddy **requires specific formats for dates** `dd/MM/yyyy` or `dd-MM-yyyy` and times `HH:mm`. If you input data in a different format, the program may display an error. <br>
   **Solution:** Double-check the format of date and time inputs before submission.

5. The `restore` command **overwrites current patient records with backup data**. This could lead to unintentional loss of recent changes. <br>
   **Solution:** Always create a new **backup** before performing a restore to preserve current records.

6. **Updating operating hours will fail** if there are existing appointments outside the new hours. <br>
   **Solution:** Use the `deleteappt` command to delete or `update` appointments that fall outside the proposed hours before making the update.

7. **If multiple backups have similar descriptions**, it may be challenging to distinguish between them.<br>
   **Solution:** Use unique and specific descriptions that include the patient names or specific changes to make backups more identifiable. Moreover, you can also refer to the time of the creation time.

8. Backup descriptions **longer than 250 characters will cause the operation to fail**.<br>
   **Solution:** Ensure backup descriptions are concise and do not exceed the character limit.

9. **Attempting to restore from an invalid or unavailable index** results in an error.<br>
   **Solution:** Use the `listbackups` command to verify available backup indexes before attempting a restore.

10. When the **backup limit (10 files) is reached, older backups are automatically overwritten** without warning.<br>
    **Solution:** Move older backups to a different folder if they need to be retained.

11. The backup list is **sorted by timestamp** but may not match user expectations (e.g., expecting sorting by index).<br>
    **Solution:** Understand that backups are sorted by creation time, not index, to locate backups accurately.
