## Beginner's Tutorial

If you're a new user, fret not! Simply follow this beginner-friendly tutorial that will walk you through your first
steps with the application, which will allow you to get comfortable with managing your student contacts effectively.

<br>

### Before You Begin
Make sure you have:
- Successfully installed Tuteez and launched the application (Refer to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section if you have not).

<br>

<br>


### Exploring the Application
Upon launching the application, you should see a window similar to the one below:

![Ui](images/Ui_userguide.png)

The *Left Panel* displays the list of students you have added. 
Separated from the left panel by a divider is the *Right Panel* displays the details of the selected student.

The *Command Box* at the bottom of the window is where you can enter commands to interact with the application.

Above the *Command Box*, you will find the *Results Box*, which displays the results of the commands you have entered.

<br>

<br>

### Starting with a Clean Slate
Let us start by clearing the sample data that comes with the application. Type `clear` in the Command Box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

You should see a message indicating that all entries have been cleared, and the list of students should now be empty.

If everything went well, you'll be greeted by this view:

![clear_command](images/clear_command.png)

<br>

<br>

### Adding Your First Student
Let's say you already have a student named John Doe, and you wish to add his details into Tuteez.

Let's try entering the following command: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/Jurong West`

This means that you've added a student named `John Doe`, with the phone number `98765432`, email `johnd@example.com`,
and address `Jurong West`.

If everything went well, you'll be greeted by this view:

![add_command](images/add_command_tutorial.png)

<div style="background-color: #D1F6FF; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info**: For more details on the `add` command, please refer to the [Add Command](#adding-a-student-add) section.
</div>

<br>

<br>

### Adding a Lesson to your Student's details
Now, you have finalized a lesson schedule with John Doe, and you wish to add it to his details.

Let's try entering the following command: `addlesson 1 l/Monday 0900-1100`

This means that you've added a lesson for `John Doe` on `Monday` from `9 am to 11 am`.

If everything went well, you'll be greeted by this view:

![addlesson_command](images/addlesson_command_tutorial.png)

<br>

### Editing Student Details
You've realized that you've made a mistake in John Doe's email address, and wish to edit it.

Let's try entering the following command: `edit 1 e/johndoe@gmail.com`

John's email address should now be updated to `johndoe@gmail.com` and the updated email address should be reflected in Tuteez.

If everything went well, you'll be greeted by this view:

![edit_command](images/edit_command_tutorial.png)

<div style="background-color: #D1F6FF; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info**: For more details on the `edit` command, please refer to the [Edit Command](#editing-a-student-edit) section.
</div>

<br>

<br>

### Deleting a Student
John Doe has decided to stop engaging your tuition services, and you wish to remove him from your list of students.

Let's try entering the following command: `delete John Doe`

John Doe should now be removed from your list of students.

If everything went well, you'll be greeted by this view:

![delete_command](images/delete_command_tutorial.png)

<br>

<br>

### Wrapping Up
Congratulations! You've successfully completed the beginner's tutorial for Tuteez.
You're now ready to move on to more advanced features and commands that Tuteez has to offer.
Simply visit the [Features](#features) section to learn more about the various commands available to you.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<br>

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Math` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Secondary`, `t/Math t/Science` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</box>

<br>

### Viewing Help: `help`

If you are in doubt, type this command to access the online user guide tailored to your needs.

**Format**: `help`

![help message](images/help_command.png)

[Take me back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<br>

<br>

### Adding a Student: `add`

You can add a new student and their personal details to your list of students.

**Format**: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [tg/TELEGRAM_USERNAME] [t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã [l/LESSON]‚Ä¶‚Äã`

<div style="background-color: #D1F6FF; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info**: Only the **name** and **phone number** are required fields. The other fields are optional.
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color: #D1F6FF; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info**:  You cannot add lessons that clash, meaning lessons cannot be scheduled on the same day and overlap in timing. If a clash is detected, the app will notify you with an error message. To see more details on valid lessons, check out the [constraints on adding a lesson](#constraints-on-adding-a-lesson)
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color: #D1F6FF; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info**: Duplicate detection of students are done by **name**, hence you cannot add a student with the same name as an existing student in tuteez. A workaround is to add numbers to the back of the name (e.g. John Doe 2).
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color: lightyellow; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">

üí° **Tip**: You can add any number of tags and lessons to a student (or you could also omit them)
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/Math l/monday 0900-1100`

[Take me back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<br>

<br>

### Deleting a Student: `delete`

You can delete a specified student from Tuteez.

**Format**: `delete INDEX` or `delete NAME`

* Deletes the student at the specified `INDEX` or by their full `NAME` (case-insensitive).
    - When using the `NAME` option, the full name of the student must be provided.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** such as 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶‚Äã

<div style="background-color: #D1F6FF; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info**: Duplicate detection of students are done by **name**. Therefore, you cannot change a student's name to match the name of an existing student in Tuteez, unless it is the same student being edited. A workaround is to add numbers to the back of the name (e.g. John Doe 2).
</div>
<br>
<div style="background-color: lightyellow; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">

üí° **Tip**: You can also use the abbreviated command `del` as a shortcut for `delete`.
</div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd student in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the first student in the results of the `find` command.
* `delete John Doe` deletes the student with the full name "John Doe" from the address book, ignoring case sensitivity.

[Take me back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<br>

<br>

### Editing a Student: `edit`

You can edit an existing student's details in Tuteez to update outdated information on the fly.

**Format**: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã`

* Edits the student at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list. The index **must be a positive integer** such as 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶‚Äã
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing **tags**, **all previous values will be replaced** by the new ones entered.
    - This means you must **retype all old tags** you wish to keep, as editing will overwrite them completely.
* You can remove all optional fields as specified in the `add` command by typing its parameter prefix (e.g. `t/`) without specifying any values after them.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st student to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd student to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

<br>

### Searching for Students: `find`

You can find students whose names, addresses, tags or lessons contain any of the given keywords. Searching by these fields is effective, as they are more likely to yield relevant matches based on how students are grouped or organized in the system.
When you are searching for lessons, you can search for lesson day and/or lesson time.

**Format**: `find [n/NAME_KEYWORDS] [a/ADDRESS_KEYWORDS] [t/TAG_KEYWORDS] [ld/LESSON_DAY_KEYWORDS] [lt/LESSON_TIME_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* Keyword must not be empty, else an error will be thrown
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* For name keywords, only the name is searched. For address keywords, only the address is searched etc.
* For words, only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Lesson day keywords must be a **day** of the week (case-insensitive), or the first 3 letters of a day e.g. `mon tue wed`
* Lesson time keywords must be in **24-hour format** `HHMM-HHMM`. Lessons with overlapping time-ranges will be matched e.g. `0800-1000` will overlap with `0900-1100`
* Persons with at least one parameter matching at least one of its keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).

<div style="background-color: #D1F6FF; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Info**: After using the find command, running another command may reset the left panel to default view. This is a feature flaw that will be resolved in future iterations.
</div>

Examples:
* `find n/alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`
* `find a/jurong` returns students with address `Jurong Lake #09-11` and `jurong west #13-21`
* `find ld/monday lt/1000-1100` returns students with lessons `monday 0800-0900` and `tuesday 0900-1030`
* `find n/John t/Science English` returns students `John Doe` with tag `Math`, `Alice Richardson` with tag `Science` and `Mary Jane` with tag `English`

## Things You Should Definitely Know

<br>

### Constraints on Adding a Lesson

Unfortunately, as of `V1.6` there are a few important constraints regarding lessons:  

  1. Lessons are not allowed to overflow into the next day.
  1. Group tuition is currently not supported, so adding overlapping or clashing lessons is not available yet.

This means the following constraints apply:

  1. Lesson start time must be before end time (e.g. `1600-1500`).
  1. Lesson start and end time cannot be identical (e.g. `1300-1300`).
  1. The latest lesson start time is `2358`.
  1. The latest lesson end time is `2359`, `0000` is treated as the start of a new day.

You can forward to [future updates](#future-features) for group tuition support!

[Take me back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<br>

### Current Limitations

As of `V1.6`, our app has a few limitations outlined below. Rest assured, we plan to resolve them in [future updates](#future-features)

1. Remarks can only be added and deleted one at a time.
2. If you wish to edit a remark, first delete the incorrect one, then add the updated version.
3. After using the find command to locate student(s), running most other commands will reset the left panel to the default view, similar to calling `list`.
4. Tags that are too long are cut off on the left panel.
5. If you wish to edit a lesson, first delete the incorrect one, then add the updated version.
6. After running edit, addremark, deleteremark, addlesson and deletelesson, the right panel will reset to the top, so you may need to scroll down to view your changes.

We appreciate your understanding and patience!

<br>

### Saving the Data

Tuteez data are saved in your hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

[Take me back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<br>

### Editing the Data File

Tuteez data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div style="background-color: #FFE4E1; padding: 4px; border-radius: 4px;">

‚ùó **Warning**: If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Tuteez will **discard all data and start with an empty data file** at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the data file before editing it.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause Tuteez to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file **only** if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?

**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Tuteez home folder.

**Q**: Can I add students with the same name?

**A**: As of `V1.6` Tuteez uniquely identifies entries by name. Hence we recommend using a student's full name if there is an existing student with the same first name and surname. We hope to address this in the future, for more info checkout [future features](#exciting-features-in-the-future).

**Q**: How can I view a student‚Äôs full details if their name or other fields are cut off in the left panel?

**A**: If a field is truncated in the left panel, use the display command with the student‚Äôs index or full name to see all their details in the right panel.

**Q**: I can‚Äôt see the left or right panel content after moving the app to a new screen. What‚Äôs wrong?

**A**: This is a known issue when switching screens. Try deleting the preferences.json file created by Tuteez, which will reset the display settings upon the next launch.

[Take me back to Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
