# WardWatch User Guide

WardWatch (WW) is a **desktop app targeted towards doctors and nurses for managing patients information in hospitals**, optimized for use via a [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary) while still having the benefits of a [Graphical User Interface (GUI)](#glossary). If you can type fast, WW can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

# Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer. Refer to this [guide](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html) to find out how.
2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/releases/).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for the WardWatch application.
4. Open a command terminal, *navigate* into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar wardwatch.jar` command to run the application. If you are unsure on how to *navigate* the terminal, refer to this [guide](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line/modules/learn-the-command-line-navigation/cheatsheet) here.<br>

A GUI similar to the image below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
<img src="images/uiLabel.png" alt="add patient result" style="pointer-events: none; width: 100%; height: auto;">

5. Type the command in the command box located at the top of the window and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br><br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all patients.
   * `add i/P23456 n/Donald Duck w/B5 d/Diabetes m/Insulin` : Adds a contact named `Donald Duck` to the patient list.
   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd patient shown in the current list.
   * `find w/ B1` : Finds all patients with ward B1.
   * `clear` : Deletes all patients.
   * `exit` : Exits the app.
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

# General Guidelines

As a [CLI-based](#glossary) application, users will interact with WardWatch by typing commands.<br> Commands typically begin with a `COMMAND_WORD`, followed by its relevant `PARAMETERS` as necessary.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

There are 5 CLI command formats as shown below:

1) `COMMAND_WORD`
2) `COMMAND_WORD INDEX`
3) `COMMAND_WORD PARAMETER`
4) `COMMAND_WORD PARAMETERS`
5) `COMMAND_WORD INDEX PARAMETERS`
   </box>

For more information on the format of `PARAMETERS`, please refer to [Input parameters](#input-parameters).

**Other things to note in this User Guide:**

1) Items in square brackets are optional:<br>
   - `n/NAME [d/DIAGNOSIS]` can be used as `n/John Doe d/diabetes` or as `n/John Doe`.
2) Parameters can be in any order: <br>
   - `n/NAME w/WARD` is equivalent to `w/WARD n/NAME`.
3) Items with …​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. 
   - `[MORE_KEYWORDS]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `Bo`, `Hans`, `Bo Hans Joe`, `Bo Han Joe Lee`, etc.
4) Extra parameters for commands without parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored: <br>
   - `help 123` is interpreted as `help`.
5) Command word is not case-sensitive: <br>
   - `list` and `LIST` are both valid commands.
6) If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Save and Storage information:**

- WardWatch data are saved in the [hard disk](#glossary) automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

- WardWatch data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/wardwatch.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, WardWatch will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause WardWatch to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

# Input parameters

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about parameters:**<br>

Parameters often take up the form of `p/[PARAMETER]` where p is the parameter symbol. For example: `add n/John Doe`<br>

- `John Doe` -> parameter.

- `makeappt 1 a/Surgery s/32-01-2024-10-00 e/32-01-2024-11-00` will trigger an error, as no month can have a 32nd day.

# FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install WardWatch in the other computer and overwrite its data file with the old data file from your previous WardWatch home folder.

**Q**: I want to edit an appointment, but there is no command for it. What now?<br>
**A**: Although you could use the [`makeappt` command](#adding-an-appointment-to-a-patient-makeappt) to overwrite an existing appointment, we do not recommend this method. Instead, we suggest deleting the existing appointment with [`delappt` command](#deleting-an-appointment-from-a-patient-delappt) first before using [`makeappt` command](#adding-an-appointment-to-a-patient-makeappt) to create a new appointment with the edited details.

**Q**: My patient's details are too long and gets cut off when displayed. How do I see it in full?<br>
**A**: To see the full details of a patient, please use the [`view` command](#viewing-a-patient-s-details-view).

# Glossary

1. **Command Line Interface (CLI):** A user interface where users interact with a computer or software by typing text-based commands. Instead of clicking on icons or buttons, users enter specific commands in a terminal or command prompt window to perform tasks.
2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical elements such as icons, buttons, and windows, rather than text-based commands. GUIs make it easier for users to navigate and use software applications visually.
3. **Hard Disk (HDD):** A storage device inside a computer that uses spinning magnetic disks to store and retrieve data, commonly used for long-term storage of files, programs, and the operating system.
4. **Substring:** A substring is any consecutive sequence of characters within a sentence. For example, in the sentence "Hello, world!", "ell", "world" and "Hello, world!" are all substrings of the entire sentence.

# Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **If you run `addnotes` command after you have filtered the patient list with `find` command**, the filter from the `find` command will be removed and the patient list will show all patients. The remedy is to run the `find` command again to filter the patient list.
