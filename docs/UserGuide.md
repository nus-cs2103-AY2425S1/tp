## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F10-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your BizBook.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar bizbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   - `list` : Lists all contacts.

   - `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   - `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   - `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   - `exit` : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for more commands and the details of each command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Parameters are composed only of letters.<br>
  e.g. `n` for the name parameter or `p` for the phone number parameter. Numbers are not valid parameter names.

- Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Parameters with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Command keywords are case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. `add` and `ADD` are both acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a table of basic commands and their usage syntax.

At the bottom, a link is provided to the user guide (where you are now!) which explains each command in greater detail.

If the application is unable to open the URL in the system's browser due to OS/browser restrictions, the URL will be
copied to clipboard instead.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
**Names:**
Names must be alphanumeric and all contacts must have unique names.
Names with symbols like "s/o" and "d/o" will not be allowed. Please write names without these symbols.
Names with additional white spaces in between words will be taken as it is.

The application will throw an error if you attempt to create two users with the same names

**Phone Numbers:**
Only Singapore phone numbers are allowed by the application. Meaning, that only phone numbers starting with the number 6, 8 or 9 and are exactly 8 digits in total is allowed.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

- Note that Name, Phone Number, Email and Address are compulsory fields.
- We believe it is reasonable that a customer or business contacts will need to provide these fields as they are not
  particularly sensitive as compared to Identification Number etc.
- The email validation does not check for the presence of a period (.) after the "@" symbol, and it does not verify any specific domain extension. It only ensures that the domain name after the "@" is at least two characters long. E.g. `@u.nus.edu`

Examples:

- `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
- `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Listing all persons : `list`

Shows a list of everyone in the address book.

`list` will result in everyone to be displayed again in the person list.

Format: `list`

### Editing a person : `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">**Caution:**
Keep in mind that names must be alphanumeric and unique.

- When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
- You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.

Examples:

- `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
- `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing the data file

BizBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/bizbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, BizBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause BizBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: There are 2 ways to transfer data.

1. If you want to use the `.json` file generated by BizBook, install the app in another computer and overwrite the data folder located at `[JAR file location]/data` with the file that contains the data from your previous BizBook home folder.
2. If you want to import using a `.vcf` file, export the data using the `export` command in BizBook, i.e. `export f/vcf`. The `.vcf` file will be located in a folder at `[JAR file location]/export/bizbook.vcf`. You can rename and transfer this file to other devices using BizBook and to import the data use the `import` command, i.e. `import f/vcf p/[Path to the VCF file]/<file name>.vcf`. Also do note that **user preferences will not be transferred over**.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **When you have extremely long tags**, the UI will not be able to display your tags properly. Text may not wrap, it may cause some parts to have scroll bars. Please avoid using excessive or really long tag names.
4. **Only one note may be added at a time**. E.g. `addnote 1 n/High profile client`. If `addnote 1 n/Supplier 1 n/Supplier 2`
   is input, only the far right note will be added. If one wishes to add notes quicker, he/she may simply use the up-arrow
   feature to quickly re-enter the command as it requires fewer keystrokes than typing an additional `n/`.
5. **Maximum number of items**, the maximum number of items (contacts, notes, tags, etc.) in this application is 2147483647. If you enter a number larger than this, the program may behave unexpectedly. However, it is unlikely that you will ever have so many contacts or tags of one contact.
6. **Contact name is a unique identifier**, this application uses the name of a contact as the unique identifier. This means that it cannot accept two of the same names in the application. Instead, consider adding the surname, use full names or, if really needed, adding numbers at the back of the name to distinguish different people.
7. **Contact names are alphanumeric**, this application only allows users to enter alphanumeric names. This means that names that include "s/o" or "d/o" are not allowed. Alternatively, consider using "so", "do" or "son of" as a replacement.
8. **Notes are alphanumeric**, similar to contact name, the notes do not allow special characters.
9. **Once selected, a person can't be unselected**, from either the contact list or pinned panel.
10. **Notes with very long content will trail off with `...`**, instead of wrapping the text and displaying the hidden content on the next line.
11. **Scrollbar in contact details appears when window is too small**, despite there being no selected contact.
