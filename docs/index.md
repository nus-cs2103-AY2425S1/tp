**F.A.R.T is a desktop application for managing contact details, catered to financial advisors.** 

While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using F.A.R.T, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing F.A.R.T, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
