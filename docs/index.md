**DocTrack is a desktop application for general practitioners (GPs) to quickly access patient contact 
details, appointments, and treatment records.** While it has a GUI, most of the user 
interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using DocTrack, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing DocTrack, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good 
  place to start.
