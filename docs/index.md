**AgentAssist is a desktop application, designed for banking sales agents to help with managing their contact
details.**
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using AgentAssist, head over to the [_Getting Started_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md#3-getting-started).
* If you are interested about developing AgentAssist, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
