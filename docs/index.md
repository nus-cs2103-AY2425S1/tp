**PlanPerfect is a desktop application designed for wedding planners to manage their contacts efficiently.** While it includes a GUI, most user interactions are performed through a CLI (Command Line Interface), catering specifically to users who prefer keyboard-based navigation.

PlanPerfect allows wedding planners to organize and manage large numbers of contacts, such as:
- Wedding photographers
- Wedding venues
- Food caterers
- Guest lists
- Other essential event-related contacts

### Key Features:
* Organize and keep track of all important contacts for wedding planning in one place.
* CLI-first approach, making it quick and efficient for users familiar with typing commands.
* Supports various organizational tasks such as managing venues, vendors, and guest lists.

* If you are interested in using PlanPerfect, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in developing PlanPerfect, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
