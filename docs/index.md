**PawPatrol is a desktop application for managing veterinary clinics' manage their patient data.**
It allows the clinic to add and edit 2 types of entities, owners and pets. PawPatrol also allows the user to link 
owners to pets, allowing the user to easily see at a glance which pets belong to which owner. It is optimised for use 
via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) which improves use speed while still having the user-friendliness of a Graphical 
User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PawPatrol can manage patient owner and pet data faster than traditional 
organisation apps.
