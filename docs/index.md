MATER (Mechanical Assistance Tracker for Efficient Repairs) is a car workshop management system designed to streamline the process of tracking vehicles, handling issues, and managing bookings. It helps workshop staff keep track of customer cars, issues (both current and past), and allows querying for common issues by vehicle.
