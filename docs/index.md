DorManagerPro (DMP) is a desktop app tailored for **university dorm managers who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)**,
designed to allow easy and efficient management of dormitory resident details within an address book.
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using DorManagerPro, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing DorManagerPro, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
