## Introducing GOATS

Are you a private tutor who has trouble keeping track of your students details? Ever wanted to have an easier way to keep track of whose parents is which students?

<br><br>
Greatest Offline AddressBook for Teaching Students (GOATS) is an **offline desktop app** designed with you in mind. It not only helps you keep track of students grades and education level, it can also help you keep track of their parent as well.

<br><br>
If you can type fast, GOATS can get your student management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
