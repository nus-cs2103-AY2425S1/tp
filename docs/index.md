**MedConnect is a desktop application for healthcare administrators in old folks homes for dementia patients to consolidate contacts of patients and related information into a single database.**

It enables speedy lookups and updates, ensuring that administrators can quickly connect with the right people, from patients' doctors to their families, when every second counts.

While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using MedConnect, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing MedConnect, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
