VBook is a **desktop app for freelance software developers to manage contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface** (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, VBook can get your contact management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* If you are interested in using VBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing VBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
