**WedLinker is a desktop application designed for professional wedding planners to seamlessly manage a variety of 
vendors and clients across different locations for a wedding.** 


While the application has a GUI, most of the user interactions happens using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
This allows for efficient and streamlined management of wedding-related contacts through text-based commands. 

WedLinker provides a centralised address book that simplifies the complexities of coordinating multiple vendors, 
venues and clients. It enhances communication and streamlines event planning tasks, making the wedding planning process 
more organised and efficient.
