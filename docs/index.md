**HireMe is a free desktop application designed to make tracking internship applications *easy*, *fast*, and *accessible* for undergraduate students.** While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using HireMe, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing HireMe, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
