**MindMap is a desktop app for quickly logging patient information and session details.** The CLI-based approach prioritizes quick data entry and organization while maintaining privacy by storing data locally, addressing the need for secure, fuss-free patient record management during sessions.

* If you are interested in using MindMap, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing MindMap, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
