**ClientGrid is a desktop application for managing your contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using ClientGrid, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing ClientGrid, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
