* **PlanPal** is an address book designed for student event planners at NUS who need to manage contacts (e.g., attendees, vendors, sponsors, and volunteers) for their events.
* PlanPal offers a centralized platform to organize, track, and access contact information, ensuring efficient coordination and smooth communication throughout the event planning process.
* While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using PlanPal, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing PlanPal, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
