This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

* Murphy's List is **contact management platform for institutes providing palliative care**. It helps users efficiently manage and organize patient contact information, ensuring proper care coordination<br>
  Example usages:
    * Keep track of current patients of the clinic
    * View pertinent medical information about the patient at a glance
    * Keep track of patient appointment dates
* The project simulates an address book in the form of a desktop application ued for managing contact details.
    * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base.
    * It is **well-designed and documented**.
* It is named `Murphy's List` (`ML` for short) because it was named after the medical prodigy `Sean Murphy` from the popular show `The Good Doctor`
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see our **[Developer Guide](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-1a/tp/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.md)**.
