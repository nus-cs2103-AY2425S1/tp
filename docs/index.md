**EduTuTu is a desktop application for managing your contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using EduTuTu, head over to the [_Installation_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#Installation).
* If you are interested about developing EduTuTu, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
