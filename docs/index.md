CareConnect is a **CLI-first** **case management application** that enables social workers to efficiently manage client details, appointments, and priorities.
While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using CareConnect, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing CareConnect, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
