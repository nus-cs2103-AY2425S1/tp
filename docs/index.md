**Clientell is a desktop application for managing your clients' finances.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
We provide an easy and fast way for you to store your client's information, be it contact details or transactions. In addition, Clientell allows you to better analyse your clients' balances through advanced commands like `summary`.

*Clientell helps you to manage your clientele.*

* If you are interested in using Clientell, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Clientell, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
