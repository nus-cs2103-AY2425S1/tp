> "Diversity in our university"

We believe that social interaction is the key to success in university. However, in a competitive environment with rising 
academic pressures, how can students ever find the time to remember names or contact details?

Presenting **CampusConnect**, the premium contact management app for NUS students. 
Featuring speedy finding and tagging features, **CampusConnect** is the number 1 most preferred contact management app on campus!
