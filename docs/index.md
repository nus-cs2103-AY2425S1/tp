**TalentConnect is designed for solo, freelance, or third-party recruiters who need to manage a large number of 
candidates and job listings.** These users often work independently, seeking a tool that helps 
them efficiently track candidate details and job requirements. While it has a GUI, most of the user 
interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using AddressBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing AddressBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
