* This is **an app for SoC students who socialise often and are looking for internships**.<br>

* The project Allows SoC students to quickly and easily manage the relationships they form with others
  in school and on their journey to acquire internships. SoC students are likely to prefer a CLI due to
  their background in computing. SoC students can most likely type fast.

* It is named `Netbook`
