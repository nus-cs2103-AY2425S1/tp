**EduVault** is a desktop application **designed for tuition centers to manage students and classes effectively**. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).


* If you are interested in using EduVault, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing EduVault, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
