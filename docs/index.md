**VolunTier is a desktop application for managing volunteering tutors in a Welfare Organisation.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using VolunTier, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing VolunTier, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
