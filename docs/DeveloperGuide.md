## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [
`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [
`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in
charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [
`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [
`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [
`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Meeting` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [
`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a
  `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [
`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* store the schedule list data i.e. all `Meeting` objects (which are contained in `UniqueMeetingList` object).
* stores the currently selected `Meeting` objects (e.g. result of search query using `see` command) as a seperate _filtered_ list.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
  `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which
`Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person`
needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [
`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="800" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data, user preference and schedule data in JSON format, and read them back into
  corresponding objects.
* inherits from `ScheduleStorage`, `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either
  one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### View meeting contacts feature

`meeting-contacts` using `FindCommand` to list contacts which are in the meeting based on UID.

<puml src="diagrams/MeetingContactsSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

### Add meetings to a schedule feature

Using `AddScheduleCommand`, we add a meeting to a schedule.

<puml src="diagrams/AddScheduleSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

### Delete meetings from the current schedule feature

Using `DeleteScheduleCommand`, we delete a meeting from the current schedule.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteScheduleSequenceDiagram.puml"/>

### Load schedule storage

Implementation of loading schedule storage. Includes behavior for when to generate sample schedule list.

<puml src="diagrams/LoadScheduleActivityDiagram.puml"/>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and
`Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th contact in the address book. The `delete` command calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be
saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new contact. The `add` command also calls
`Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will
not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the
`undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once
to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no
previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the
case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the
lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address
book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()`
to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as
`list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus,
the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the contact being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* Busy Students and Professionals with a need to coordinate available meeting times with their contacts

**Value proposition**: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

Our application helps to coordinate meeting timings with relevant contacts, by keeping track of the schedules of the
userâ€™s contacts. This will be very useful for busy Students and Professionals that have many meetings with different
people throughout the day.

By making the commands similar to Natural Language, our application aims to provide a user-centric experience. The ease
of use would make the product an attractive alternative to current Calendar applications that require the user to
navigate multiple screens and input their meetings.

    1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be
       optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a contact

1. Deleting a contact while all contacts are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all contacts using the `list` command. Multiple contacts in the list.

    1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
       Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message.
       Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
       Expected: No contact is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data

1. Test case: Dealing with missing data files.

    1. Delete all existing data files such as `addressbook.json` and `schedule.json`.
    1. Run jar file as per normal, `java -jar SeeRee2.0.jar`.
    1. **Expected**: `addressbook.json` and `schedule.json` will be created an populated with sample data.

2. Test case: Dealing with corrupted files. In this test, corrupted refers to invalid JSON format.

    1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure `addressbook.json` and `schedule.json` exists and are populated.
    1. From both of the files, remove the first line with the opening bracket `{`. This will render both files as invalid JSON format.
    1. Run jar file as per normal, `java -jar SeeRee2.0.jar`.
    1. **Expected**: Program will render both files invalid JSON format and empty `addressbook` and `schedulelist` will be created.

3. Test case: Dealing with corrupted files. In this test, corrupted refers to valid JSON format with missing fields.

    1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure `addressbook.json` and `schedule.json` exists and are populated.
    1. From both of the files, remove some fields while maintaining valid JSON format.
    1. Run jar file as per normal, `java -jar SeeRee2.0.jar`.
    1. **Expected**: Program will remove entries which has invalid/missing fields while keeping valid entries. A backup of the invalid file is created as `schedule.json.*.bak` and `addressbook.json.*.bak`.

          updated details of the schedule.

    1. **Test case**: `edit-schedule 1`
        - **Expected**: No schedule is edited. Error message displays as at least one field (`n/NAME`, `d/DATE`,
          `t/TIME`, or `c/INDEX`) must be specified. Status bar remains the same.

    1. **Test case**: `edit-schedule 0 n/Team Meeting`
        - **Expected**: No schedule is edited. Error message indicates invalid index. Status bar remains the same.

    1. **Test case**: `edit-schedule 1 c/2 c/3 c/4`
        - **Expected**: Schedule 1 is updated:
            - Contacts `2` and `3` are removed if they were already included.
            - Contact `4` is added if not already in the schedule.

    1. Expected: Similar to Scenario 1

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

Team size: 5

1. **Modify flow of [loading schedule storage](#load-schedule-storage) to check for if address book sample data generated first.**
   Currently when the programs loads with missing `addressbook.json` and valid `schedule.json`, the program will generate sample contacts data while retaining old schedule list.
   Ideal in this situation we want to backup `schedule.json` and create new schedule list from sample data too to match sample data from addressbook.
1. **Provide GUI warning that data files was not read properly ontop of logging.**
   Currently only logging is provided when data files is read incorrectly.
   Can include some visual error message or the likes from the GUI end to indicate that data files was read incorrectly.
1. **Modify meeting sample data to generate whole number timings.**
   Currently time fields for meetings sample data is generated using `LocalTime#now` which provides very precise timing up to the milliseconds.
   While it is not wrong, some user complained that it looks wrong or invalid to display timings as such, and it would be much appropriate to display time fields as available to the users through other commands, i.e. if user cannot add time field up to milliseconds of precision, do not display time fields up to milliseconds of precision.
1. **Modify Date Time Logic for Invalid Dates.**
   Currently, Java LocalDate library helps to correct the string if the user types in invalid dates like `29-02-2023` to `28-02-2023`. We plan to improve the logic such that our application has better logic to detect Leap Year Dates.
1. **Add another UI view to display information fully for long inputs.**
   Currently, certain UI text get truncated when inputs are long and are not able to be seen in the current iteration of the UI.
   While it is not wrong to assume that most meetings and names will not be that long (since "Dinner with Jane, Josh and Edward" can be summarised to "Dinner" as the contacts should be already associated with the meeting and be displayed),
   however having a separate view to showcase fully the details of long meeting names and contact may be useful for edge cases.
1. **Favourited contacts can be shown at the top of the list.**
   Currently, the only indicator of favourite contacts depends on the color of the star beside the respective contact details and serve minimal purpose. 
   Intuitively, favouriting a contact should be similar to adding a contact to speed dial where the details of the favourited contact can be quickly accessed and should thus be shown at the top of the list.
1. **Modify Schedule display.**
   Currently, there are a few feature flaws with the current UI of the scheduler. When the application is resized to be too small or have too many meetings on the same day, the scrollbars of the Ui causes a white box to appear, additionally meetings are not displayed in chronological order but instead by index.
   Future improvement to the Ui could include having a proper weekly calendar with timeslot and timings, where meetings could be given a duration and will take up the respective timeslot for better user clarity when it comes to managing their time. 
   Scrollbar could also then be removed if the calendar/scheduler was shifted to another view to fully make use of the application size instead of squeezing it in a split view.
1. **Shift Sunday to be displayed first in scheduler.**
   Currently, Sunday is being displayed as the last day in the scheduler, however the scheduler treats Sunday as the first day of the week.
   While the current iteration is not wrong, however users may be confused and assume the Sunday at the end of the list to be the Sunday of the following week since it comes after Saturday.
   Thus for clarity, Sunday should instead be displayed at the start of the scheduler instead.
1. **Enhance clear command.**
   Currently, the clear command clears all contacts even if they are in the meeting. This is not ideal since the contacts are remained in the meeting even though they are deleted.
   Instead, the error message should be displayed if the contact is in the meeting and the user should be prompted to remove the contact from the meeting first before deleting the contact.
