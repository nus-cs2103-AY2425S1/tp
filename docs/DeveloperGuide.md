## **Acknowledgements**

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the SE-EDU initiative.
* Libraries used: JavaFX, Jackson, JUnit5
* The autocomplete feature was adapted and overhauled from a similar feature in [AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-2's tp](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W12-2/tp). We analysed their code and made significant changes to tailor the feature to fit the needs of Medconnect.
* The undo and redo features were inspired by the proposed implementation found in [AB3's Developer Guide](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html#proposed-undoredo-feature).

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### Implementation

The image below shows the class diagram of a Person object and its related class attributes.

![Person Class Diagram](images/PersonClassDiagram.png)

The Person object is made up of several attributes:
* `Name`: The name of the patient.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the patient.
* `Email`: The email of the patient.
* `Address`: The address of the patient.
* `Doctor`: The doctor assigned to the patient.
* `Emergency Contact`: A list of emergency contacts of the patient.
* `Tags`: Additional information about the patient.

The Doctor object is also made up of attributes:
* `Doctor Name`: The name and title of the doctor.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the doctor.
* `Email`: The email of the doctor.

The Emergency Contact object is also made up of attributes:
* `Name`: The name of the emergency contact.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the emergency contact.
* `Relationship`: The relationship of the emergency contact to the patient.

#### Feature details

1. MedConnect will verify that the parameters supplied by the user follow a set of relevant restrictions for the respective parameters.
2. If any invalid parameter is provided, an error will be thrown, informing the user which parameter violates the restrictions. The format for the valid input for that parameter will be displayed to the user.
3. If all parameters are valid, a new `Person` entry will be created and stored in the `VersionedAddressBook`.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: The required input of parameters:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make all parameters compulsory, except Tags.
  * Pros: Will not have missing data when it is needed in an emergency.
  * Cons: Add Command is lengthy to type out, might be hard to remember the syntax.
* **Alternative 2:** Make only a few specific parameters compulsory.
  * Pros: Patient registration will be faster.
  * Cons: If user forgets to update missing details, there will be no one to contact in an emergency.

We opted for Alternative 1 to make almost all parameters compulsory as the autocomplete feature we implemented will aid users in typing out the Add Command.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Data archiving

#### Implementation

The archive functionality in MedConnect is facilitated by the `ModelManager` class. It handles the archiving, listing, loading, and deleting of archived contact data. The `ModelManager` interacts with the `Model` and `Storage` components to manage archived data.

For example, the sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `ModelManager` component when the `archive` command is executed.

  The system should respond to user commands (e.g., adding, updating, or viewing contacts) within **2 seconds** for typical operations under normal usage conditions (i.e., up to 1000 contacts in the database).

- **Scalability:**
  MedConnect should support operations with **up to 5000 contacts** without performance degradation. Basic operations such as retrieving or adding contacts should not exceed a response time of **3 seconds** under this load.

#### 2. Reliability and Availability:
- **System Uptime:**
  MedConnect must be available for use at least **99% of the time**, especially during hospital operating hours (24/7 access). Regular maintenance should be scheduled during off-peak times.

- **Disaster Recovery and Backup:**
  Contact data must be backed up **daily** to prevent data loss. The system should be able to recover from backup within **2 hours** of a failure.

#### 3. Usability Requirements:
- **Typing Efficiency:**
  The system should be optimized for keyboard-only interactions. A user familiar with the system should be able to complete key operations (e.g., adding a new contact, viewing emergency contacts) in less than **30 seconds** using only the keyboard.

- **Error Handling and Feedback:**
  The system must provide **immediate feedback** (within 1 second) when an error occurs, such as invalid input or missing fields. The user should be able to correct errors without restarting the operation.

#### 4. Security and Privacy Requirements:
- **Data Encryption:**
  All sensitive patient and contact information must be encrypted when stored locally. The system should implement industry-standard encryption (e.g., AES-256) for both storage and transmission of data.

- **User Authentication (Future Consideration):**
  If the system evolves to handle multiple users, it must implement **role-based access control** with password authentication. Healthcare administrators should have different access levels than general staff.

#### 5. Data and Storage Requirements:
- **Human-Editable File Format:**
  Contact information should be stored in a **human-readable and editable format** (e.g., `.txt` or `.csv`) so that administrators can manually access and modify data if needed.

- **Data Integrity:**
  The system must ensure that no data is lost or corrupted during common operations (e.g., adding, updating, or deleting contacts). **Transaction-like behavior** must be implemented to ensure all data operations either succeed fully or fail without partially corrupting data.

#### 6. Compatibility and Portability:
- **Cross-Platform Support:**
  MedConnect must be compatible with **mainstream operating systems** (Windows, macOS, Linux) and function seamlessly on systems with **Java 17 or higher** installed.

#### 7. Compliance Requirements:
- **Healthcare Data Regulations:**
  MedConnect must adhere to local and international healthcare data protection regulations, such as **HIPAA** in the US, or similar regulations in other regions, ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive medical information.

#### 8. Maintainability and Extensibility:
- **Modular Design:**
  The system must be designed with a modular structure, allowing future extensions such as additional data fields or user roles without requiring significant rework.

- **Testability:**
  MedConnect must be **easily testable**, with automated tests that can cover at least **80% of the codebase**. Each core feature (e.g., adding a contact, deleting outdated contacts) should have dedicated test cases.
