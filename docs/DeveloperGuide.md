## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `mark -s 1 active`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagramMarkSupplier.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SupplierListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `DeliveryListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Supplier`  and `Delivery` object(s) residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete -s 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSupplierSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -s 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteSupplierCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteSupplierCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteSupplierCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a supplier).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `DeleteSupplierCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `DeleteSupplierCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddSupplierCommandParser`, `DeleteSupplierCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="500" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Supplier` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueSupplierList` object).
* stores the Supplier objects in 2 separate lists, filteredSuppliers and sortedSuppliers. These lists hold the 
filtered supplier list and sorted supplier list respectively, and the displayed list will be determined based on the 
last executed command. Deliveries are also stored and displayed in a similar manner.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="650" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance Requirements
1. The system should respond to user input within 2 seconds for all CRUD operations on contacts and deliveries (e.g., adding, deleting, searching).
2. The application should take no longer than 5 seconds to launch and load all necessary data (e.g., contacts, deliveries) on any supported platform.

#### Scalability Requirements
3. The system should be able to handle at least 100 contacts and 200 deliveries without noticeable degradation in performance.

#### Usability Requirements
4. A user with typing speed of more than 50 words per minute for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

#### Compatibility / Portability Requirements
5. Should work on any mainstream OS as long as it has Java 17 or above installed without requiring platform-specific dependencies.
6. The product should work as a standalone JAR file, not exceeding 100MB in size without needing an installer.

#### Data Requirements
7. The system should not use any Database Management System (DBMS) for data storage. The contacts and deliveries data should be stored locally in a human-editable file.
8. The system should ensure that the data file remains consistent and free from corruption across system crashes or improper shutdowns.

#### Security Requirements
9. The system should ensure that user data (e.g., supplier contacts, delivery information) is only accessible by the user of the local machine.

#### Maintainability Requirements
10. The system should follow Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to facilitate future maintenance and feature additions.
11. The project should be developed in a breadth-first incremental manner, with consistent delivery of features over the course of the development cycle.

#### Testability Requirements
12. The system should be designed to support unit and integration testing, with testable modules and clearly defined boundaries.
13. The application should not depend on any external remote servers for its core functionality, ensuring that the product can be tested and used offline without network dependencies.

### Glossary

* **Breadth-first Incremental Manner**: An approach to software development where features are implemented across the entire scope of the project in shallow layers, gradually adding depth and complexity over time. This method ensures that all major components of the system are developed in parallel, allowing for early integration and testing of the overall system structure.
* **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**: A text-based interface where users interact with the system by typing commands, as opposed to using a graphical interface with mouse clicks.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level
VendorVault is significantly more complex than Address Book 3 (AB3). While AB3 deals with a single entity (Person), 
VendorVault deals with two entities (Supplier and Delivery), thus more effort is required to manage and integrate the two entities seamlessly. 
Apart from introducing new commands, the UI was also improved to support displaying both entities in a user-friendly manner.

### Challenges Faced

#### New Commands
New commands, such as sorting, had to be integrated with existing commands to ensure the expected and accurate behaviour was achieved.

#### Data Storage
JSON storage architecture had to be updated to accommodate both suppliers and deliveries, while ensuring format consistency and ease of retrieval.

#### UI Design
Designing and implementing an intuitive user interface that displays all required information in a non-cluttered way took considerable time. 
Ensuring a smooth user experience for all user actions required additional logic to ensure commands work seamlessly together.

### Effort Required
VendorVault is estimated to have taken 1.5x the expected effort. This was due to:
- Improving existing commands and implementing new commands from scratch.
- Providing comprehensive test coverage across all commands.
- Performing extensive manual testing to ensure a smooth user experience and cohesive user interface.

### Achievements
The team managed to successfully implement various essential and helpful commands in VendorVault to meet the needs of small convenience/grocery stores. 
The wide variety of commands and intuitive user interface serves to benefit the target users greatly.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Enhancement 1**: Make deletion of suppliers with pending deliveries throw a warning and error message.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows users to delete suppliers with pending deliveries without any warning. 
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to add a warning message when a user tries to delete a supplier with pending deliveries.
     * e.g. "Warning: Unable to delete supplier. There are pending deliveries associated with this supplier."

<br></br>
2. **Enhancement 2**: Make marking an active supplier with pending deliveries inactive throw a warning and error message.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows users to mark active suppliers with pending deliveries as inactive without any warning.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to add a warning message when a user tries to mark an active supplier with pending deliveries as inactive.
     * e.g. "Warning: Unable to mark supplier as inactive. There are pending deliveries associated with this supplier."

<br></br>
3. **Enhancement 3**: Make improvements to detect duplicate suppliers. 
   * **Description**: The current implementation defines duplicate suppliers as suppliers with the same name and company name.
   However, it allows users to add duplicate suppliers with names with different case (e.g. "John Doe" and "john doe")
   and multiple spacings (e.g. "John Doe" and "John   Doe").
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to redefine duplicate suppliers as suppliers with the same name and phone number. 
     For the supplier name, we plan to make improvements to detect duplicate suppliers case-insensitively.
     Supplier names with multiple spacings will also be considered as the same supplier.
     Under this new implementation, suppliers are not allowed to have the same name and phone number. 
     * e.g. "Warning: Duplicate supplier 'John Doe' already exists. Please use a different name."
     * e.g. "Warning: Duplicate supplier with the same phone number '98765432' already exists. Please use a different phone number."

<br></br>
4. **Enhancement 4**: Make adding a delivery of a product that is not supplied by the supplier throw a warning and error message.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows users to add a delivery of a product that is not supplied by the supplier without any warning.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to add a warning message when a user tries to add a delivery of a product that is not supplied by the supplier.
     * e.g. "Warning: Unable to add delivery. The product is not supplied by the selected supplier."

<br></br>
5. **Enhancement 5**: Make adding supplier tags check for duplicates case-insensitively and throw a warning message.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows users to add duplicate tags with different case (e.g. "friends" and "Friends").
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to check for duplicate tags case-insensitively and throw a warning message.
     * e.g. "Warning: Duplicate tag 'friends' already exists. Please use a different tag."

<br></br>
6. **Enhancement 6**: Make improvements to detect duplicate deliveries. 
   * **Description**: The current implementation defines duplicate deliveries as deliveries
   with the same supplier, product, delivery date and time, cost, and quantity.
   However, it allows users to add duplicate deliveries with different case for the product name (e.g. "bread" and "Bread").
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to check for duplicate deliveries case-insensitively for the product name and throw a warning message.
     * "Warning: Duplicate supplier detected. Please use a different name/phone number."

<br></br>
7. **Enhancement 7**: Make upcoming command throw an error when the date and time input for the `aft/DELIVERY_DATE_TIME` parameter is later than the date and time input for parameter `bef/DELIVERY_DATE_TIME`.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows users to key in an invalid date range for PENDING deliveries for the upcoming command without any warning.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to add an error message when a user tries to use the upcoming command with an invalid date range where the `bef/DELIVERY_DATE_TIME` parameter has an earlier date and time than the `aft/DELIVERY_DATE_TIME` parameter.
     * e.g. "Warning: `The DELIVERY_DATE_TIME` value for the `aft/ DELIVERY_DATE_TIME` parameter should be earlier than the value for `bef/DELIVERY_DATE_TIME`."

<br></br>
8. **Enhancement 8**: Allow for adding a supplier name with special characters.
   * **Description**: The current implementation only allows for alphanumeric characters in the supplier name.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to allow for adding a supplier name with special characters.
     * e.g. "add -s n/John Doe & Sons p/98765432
     * e.g. "add -s n/John Doe s/o connor p/98765432

<br></br>
9. **Enhancement 9**: Better input checks for invalid date in commands that require date input.
   * **Description**: The current implementation allows for certain invalid dates
    because the LocalDateTime module automatically converts the date to the first previous valid date
   * e.g. "add -d on/31-04-2023 15:00 s/1 pro/bread q/500 g c/5.50" (For months with less than 31 days,
   the date is converted to the last day of the previous month)
   * e.g. "add -d on/29-02-2023 15:00 s/1 pro/bread q/500 g c/5.50" (For non-leap years, the date is converted to 28-02-2023)
   * No error message is shown.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to add better input checks for invalid dates in commands that require date input. <br>

<br></br>
10. **Enhancement 10**: Allow finding deliveries by date and time range.
   * **Description**: The current implementation only allows finding deliveries by a single date and time.
   * **Tasks**:
     * We plan to allow users to find deliveries within a specified date and time range.
     * e.g. "find -d aft/18-01-2023 12:00 bef/18-01-2023 18:00 stat/DELIVERED"
