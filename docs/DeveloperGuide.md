### Architecture

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/developer-guide-images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `PersonPane`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div class="page-break"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/developer-guide-images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `PROpertyParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a client).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PROpertyParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `PROpertyParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div class="page-break"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `PROperty`, which `Person` references. This allows `PROperty` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/developer-guide-images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
    
### Add Client Feature

the AddCommand follows a typical command pattern where `LogicManager` orchestrates the parsing and execution process. 
When the user input is received, `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to interpret and parse the user input string into an executable command.
In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `AddCommandParser` to parse user input string.

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide-images//AddSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the values corresponding to the prefixes `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `a/`, `t/` and `r/`.
`AddressBookParser` ensures that:
- All values corresponding to the prefixes are valid
  If any of the above constraints are violated, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException. Otherwise, 
  `AddCommandParser` creates an `AddCommand` instance with a `Person` object representing the new client.

Upon execution, `AddCommand` first queries the supplied model if it contains a client. If no duplicate client exists, `AddCommand` then calls on `model::addPerson` to add the client into the contact list.

### Add Listing Feature

The ListingAddCommand follows a typical command pattern where `LogicManager` orchestrates the parsing and execution process.
When the user input is received, `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` to interpret and parse the user input string into an executable command.
In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `ListingCommandsParser` to parse user input string.

![AddListingSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide-images//AddListingSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

`ListingCommandsParser` first obtains the user input string and ensures that the suffix of the command matches 'add' or 'delete'. 
 If the suffix does not match either, `ListingCommandsParser` throws a ParseException. Otherwise,
 `ListingCommandsParser` creates `ListingAddCommandParser` to parse the arguments.

`ListingAddCommandParser` then extracts the index and the values corresponding to the prefixes `t/` and `a/`.
`ListingAddCommandParser` ensures that:
- Provided index is within a valid range, meaning it cannot be less than 1 or greater than the number of clients in the currently displayed list.
- All values corresponding to the prefixes are valid.

If any of the above constraints are violated, `ListingAddCommandParser` throws a ParseException. Otherwise,
`ListingAddCommandParser` creates an `ListingAddCommand` instance with a `Listing` object representing the new listing.

Upon execution, `ListingAddCommand` first attempts to add a listing in a `UniqueListingList`. If no duplicate listing exists,
`UniqueListingList` then adds the listing to its list. 

### Sort Feature


The sort feature in `PROperty` is implemented by adding sorting methods to the `UniquePersonList` class, which is responsible for managing the list of `Person` objects. Sorting is performed directly on the `internalList` by specific attributes such as `name` or `ID`, allowing users to organise clients in a meaningful order.

The feature includes the following operations:

- **`UniquePersonList#sortByName()`** â€” Sorts the `internalList` of `Person` objects alphabetically by name, using a `Comparator` that performs a case-insensitive comparison.
- **`UniquePersonList#sortByID()`** â€” Sorts the `internalList` by ID in ascending order, allowing users to organise clients based on their unique identifiers.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#sortByName()` and `Model#sortByID()` respectively.


The following sequence diagram shows how an sort operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide-images//SortSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

Similarly, the sorting process within the `Model` component is shown below:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/developer-guide-images//SortSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

## **Appendix A: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Property Agents who type fast

Their responsibilities include managing a large list of property listings,
coordinating with clients and potential buyers, conducting property viewings, negotiating deals,
and handling paperwork related to real estate transactions. They are often mobile, needing quick and easy
access to information, and manage a large client and property database.

**Value proposition**:
PROperty is useful for property agents because it saves their time by allowing easy tracking of contacts,
and easily filtering them according to tailor-made categories relevant to property agents in Singapore. It is much
simpler to use while being even more functional than alternatives on the market.

* Allows property agents to manage prospective and existing clients easily by sorting them into different
  categories such as by housing type or seller/buyer
* Keep track of the various landlords who own the houses
* Easy for agent to remember who to try to sell unit to
* Events for scheduling visits to houses - reminders for agents when they open the app on any upcoming visits

## **Appendix B: Planned Enhancements**

**Team Size:** 5 members

As we continue to develop PROperty, we are focused on refining and expanding its capabilities to better meet user needs. 
Through identifying current limitations, weâ€™re able to target areas that can benefit most from enhancement. 
This section highlights our planned improvements, showcasing the steps we're taking to deliver a more comprehensive and effective solution for property agents.


### 1. Enhance Phone Numbers to Accept Special Characters

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

At present, phone numbers only accept numeric characters, excluding symbols such as `+` and dashes `-`. 
However, these characters are essential for supporting country and area codes, and dashes can improve readability by 
separating sections of a phone number (e.g., `+1-800-9087-2029`).

**Proposed Enhancement**

We plan to modify the phone number field to allow `+` symbols and dashes `-` so users can input phone numbers with country/area codes 
and use dashes for better readability. This enhancement will provide greater flexibility and accommodate a wider range of valid phone number formats.

### 2. Enhance Search Flexibility

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

The current search functionality is limited when searching for strings containing alphanumeric characters followed by special characters (e.g. "29," in an address),
or special characters followed by alphanumeric characters (e.g "#03-02" in a unit number). 
Users may not find their intended client if they do not explicitly state the exact string due to this restriction
(e.g. using `find 29` to find a client with the address `Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40` will result in no clients being found).

**Proposed Enhancement**

We plan to enhance the search feature to allow partial matches on numeric values regardless of punctuation or spacing. 
This enhancement will improve the user experience by showing relevant client details even if the input includes numbers adjacent to punctuation marks.

### 3. Enhance Export Feature to Handle Export Errors.

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

At present, the PROperty does not indicate to the user when an export fails (e.g. If the user exports a csv file and opens it, 
then edits information using the app and exports the csv again, 
the second export will cause an error and the new CSV file will not be correctly exported.
However, the PROperty GUI reflects that a second export command has been successfully executed, 
even though the console shows that an error has been thrown).

**Proposed Enhancement**

We plan to enhance the export feature by implementing error handling should there be a failed export. 
This enhancement will improve the user experience by informing the user when their export has failed,
and prevent confusion when the user checks their CSV file to find there has been no updates to its contents.

## **Appendix C: Instructions for Manual Testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch
   
   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
   
   2. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample clients. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences
   
   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
   
   2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
      
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Adding a client

1. Adding a new client to the client list

    1. Prerequisites: The client list is displayed, and the user has relevant details to add a new client.

    2. Test case: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@example.com a/123 Clementi Road`<br>
       Expected: A new client with the name "John Doe" and provided details is added to the list. The status message in the outcome box confirms the addition.

    3. Test case: `add n/ p/ e/ a/`<br>
       Expected: No client is added. An error message appears, indicating that names should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it should not be blank.

    4. Other incorrect add commands to try: `add`, `add n/John Doe p/@456789`, `add n/Harry Kane p/88332255 e/harrykane.com a/123 Clementi Road`<br>
       Expected: Error message indicating invalid command, phone or email format, with no changes to the list.


### Deleting a client

1. Deleting a client while all clients are being shown
   
   1. Prerequisites: List all clients using the `list` command. Multiple clients in the list.
   
   2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First client is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted client shown in the status message.
   
   3. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No client is deleted. Error details shown in the status message.
   
   4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.
