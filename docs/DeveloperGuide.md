## **Setting up, getting started**

### Setting up the project in your computer

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
Follow the steps in the following guide precisely. Things will not work out if you deviate in some steps.

</box>

First, **fork** this repo, and **clone** the fork into your computer.

If you plan to use Intellij IDEA (highly recommended):

1. **Configure the JDK**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to ensure Intellij is configured to use **JDK 17**.
2. **Import the project as a Gradle project**: Follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) to import the project into IDEA.
   <box type="warning" seamless>
   Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
   </box>
3. **Verify the setup**:
   1. Run the `seedu.address.Main` and try a few commands.
   2. [Run the tests](#running-tests) to ensure they all pass.

### Running Tests

There are two ways to run tests.

* **Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner**
    * To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
    * To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package,
      test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`
* **Method 2: Using Gradle**
    * Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Link**: Read [this Gradle Tutorial from the se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html) to learn more about using Gradle.

</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Before writing code

1. **Configure the coding style**

   If using IDEA, follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html) to set up IDEA's coding style to match ours.

   <box type="tip" seamless>

   **Tip:**
   Optionally, you can follow the guide [_[se-edu/guides] Using Checkstyle_](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) to find how to use the CheckStyle within IDEA e.g., to report problems _as_ you write code.

   </box>

2. **Set up CI**

   This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows` folder). When GitHub detects those files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the `master` branch or to any PR. No set up required.

3. **Learn the design**

   When you are ready to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading about [TrueRentalâ€™s architecture](DeveloperGuide.md#architecture).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the application.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the application launch and shut down.

* At application launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the application in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `cadd n/John ...` (details of command are omitted).

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("rview 1")` API
call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/ViewRentalSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `rview 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ViewRentalCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component,
taking `execute("cadd n/John Doe p/91231231 e/john@example.com")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/AddClientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `cadd n/John Doe p/91231231 e/john@example.com` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddClientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteClientCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteClientCommand`)
   which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a [_client_](#glossary-client)).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteClientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="890" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`,
which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of
each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** :
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both TrueRental's data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`).
* has a separate portion to store the current session's command history into a text file.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Confirmation prompts

Some commands such as `clear`, `cdelete` and `rdelete` prompts the user for confirmation.

How confirmation prompts work:

* The `CommandResult` class now has different types:
  * **`ORDINARY`**: A regular result, representing a command's success.
  * **`SHOW_HELP`**: The help window should be shown to the user.
  * **`EXIT`**: The app should exit.
  * **`PROMPT`**: The app should prompt the user for confirmation.
* There is a new `Supplier<CommandResult>` field in the `CommandResult` class, which will be applied when the user
  confirms the prompt.
* In commands that will prompt for confirmation, the `execute` method returns a `CommandResult` that contains an
  additional `Supplier<Command>` and prompt message.
* The `LogicManager` detects if the result of a command is of the type `PROMPT`, and enters a state where it waits for
  a confirmation.
* `LogicManager` also keeps track of the most recent `CommandResult`. When a confirmation is obtained, it will apply
  the supplier in the previous `CommandResult`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions involved in confirmation prompts, taking the command `clear`
as an example:

<puml src="diagrams/ClearSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `clear` Command" />

### Importing and Exporting data

The user is able to import data from and export data to external files.

How import and export work:

* A <ins>[`FileChooser`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/stage/FileChooser.html)</ins> resides in
  the `MainWindow` container.
* The `CommandResult` class now has two new types:
  * **`IMPORT`**: The `FileChooser` window should be shown to the user to choose a file for import.
  * **`EXPORT`**: The `FileChooser` window should be shown to the user to choose a file for export.
* `CommandResult` of the above types store an extra `Supplier<CommandResult>` that will be applied if import or export
  was successful.
* The `MainWindow` detects if a result returned by `LogicManager` is of type `IMPORT` or `EXPORT`, and shows the
  correct `FileChooser` window based on the type.
* After the user chooses a file, `MainWindow` passes the file to `LogicManager` by calling the `processFile` method.
* `LogicManager` passes the file to the `Storage` component to import or export data via the `readAddressBook` and
  `saveAddressBook` methods.
* If the import or export was successful, `LogicManager` applies the supplier in the most recent `CommandResult`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic`, `UI` and `Storage` components when
importing or exporting data, taking the command `export` as an example:

<puml src="diagrams/ExportSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic, UI and Storage Component for the `export` Command" />

## Duplicate Client Detection and Handling

A client is only considered as **duplicate** **if and only if** all three parameters `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`
and `EMAIL_ADDRESS` are **exactly the same** (including case sensitivity).

This is to allow the user to have a greater flexibility of manipulating the client's information.

**For example:** All the clients stated below the initial client are **NOT CONSIDERED** as duplicates.

<box type="info" light>

An **initial client** with the name `Jason Lee`, phone number `91231231` and email address `jasonlee@example.com`

</box>

<box type="success" light>

The following are **NOT DUPLICATES** of the initial client:

1. A client with the name `Jason Lee`, phone number `99998888` and email address `jasonlee@example.com`.
2. A client with the name `Jason Lee`, phone number `91231231` and email address `NOTjasonlee@example.com`.
3. A client with the name `Jason Lee`, phone number `â€”` and email address `jasonlee@example.com`.
4. A client with the name `Jason Lee`, phone number `91231231` and email address `â€”`.
5. A client with the name `JASON LEE`, phone number `91231231` and email address `jasonlee@example.com`.

## Duplicate Rental Information Detection and Handling

Rental information is considered a **duplicate** **if and only if** the `ADDRESS` parameter is **exactly the same**, including case sensitivity.

#### 2. `cedit` Command

The current version of `cedit` only supports replacing **all tags** with the **updated tag** provided by the `cedit`
command.
In the future, there will be an update to the `cedit` command, where the user is able to choose which tag to **retain** as well as which tag to **edit**.

#### 3. `redit` Command

The current version of `redit` only supports replacing existing value to the newly specified value for all parameters used in `redit`.
In the future, there will be an update to the `redit` command, where the user is able to choose whether to edit from the existing value or simply replace the existing value, offering greater convenience.

#### 4. `sort` Command

The current version of `sort` is case-sensitive.
In the future, there will be an update to the `sort` command, where the sorting will be case-insensitive.

#### 5. `RENT_DUE_DATE` Parameter

The current `RENT_DUE_DATE` meant to refer to the specific day (of the month) on which the rent payment is due for the property owned by the client. However, the term `DATE` may be misleading, as users might assume it requires the format `dd/mm/yyyy`.
In the future, there will be an update to the `RENT_DUE_DATE` parameter, where it will be renamed to `RENT_DUE_DAY` for greater clarity.

#### 6. Error Message For Invalid Value Of `MONTHLY_RENT` Parameter

The current error message for an invalid value of `MONTHLY_RENT` is: `Monthly Rent should only contain numbers, and in 2 decimal places if needed`. This message may be misleading, as the term `numbers` is too vague.
In the future, there will be an update to the error message for invalid value of `MONTHLY_RENT`, where it will be rephrased to `Monthly Rent should only contain positive numbers (including 0, with no leading zeroes), and be formatted with exactly 2 decimal places if needed` for greater clarity.

#### 7. Error Message For Invalid Value Of `DEPOSIT` Parameter

The current error message for an invalid value of `DEPOSIT` is: `Deposit should only contain numbers, and in 2 decimal places if needed`. This message may be misleading, as the term `numbers` is too vague.
In the future, there will be an update to the error message for invalid value of `DEPOSIT`, where it will be rephrased to `Deposit should only contain positive numbers (including 0, with no leading zeroes), and be formatted with exactly 2 decimal places if needed` for greater clarity.

#### 8. Duplicate Rental Information Detection

Currently, rental information is considered a duplicate if and only if the `ADDRESS` parameter **matches exactly**, **including case sensitivity**. However, this approach may not be ideal as unique identifiers such as unit numbers can differentiate addresses that are otherwise the same.
In the future, there will be an update to the duplicate rental information detection method, where rental information will be considered a duplicate if and only if the `ADDRESS` parameter **matches** (**case-insensitively**).

#### 9. Handling Long Text In The UI

Currently, some long texts are truncated due to the window size constraints of the application, with excess text displayed as `...`.
In the future, there will be an update to the UI and additional constraints on the parameter value. The UI will be updated such that all characters will be fully displayed without truncation or the use of `...`.

#### 10. Storage Related Error Handling

In some very rare cases, reading from or writing to data file may fail due to various reasons.
In the future, there will be an update to the application, where a prompt will be displayed to notify the user of such failures.
