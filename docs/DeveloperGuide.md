## **Design**

### Architecture

This architecture diagram gives a high-level overview of the app's design.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

**Architecture Components**

**`Main`** consists of [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ddd/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ddd/MainApp.java), and is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The app consists of the following components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): Renders user interface (UI) components of the app.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Exexcutes commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): In-memory representation of the app's data.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Stores data locally.
* [**`Commons`**](#common-classes): A collection of classes used by multiple components.

**Component Interactions**

This sequence diagram shows how the components interact with each other for a scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

With the exception of `Commons`, each component is structured as such:

* Component API is defined in an `interface` named `XYZ`, where XYZ is the name of the component.
* Implements its functionality using a concrete `XYZManager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

### UI Component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ddd/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `DisplayedListPanel` etc. Each UI component inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/ddd/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component:

* Takes user input and pass it to the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Depends on `Model` (specifically `Client`, `Vendor` and `Event`) since it render data from the items inside `Model`.

When a user executes a command, the results of their command will be rendered within a single `DisplayedListPanel`. `DisplayedListPanel` contains some number of `DisplayedCard`, which could either be a `ClientCard`, `VendorCard` or an `EventCard`.

The items that need to be displayed on the GUI is stored in an `ObservableList<Displayable>`, and are retrieved from the `Model` using `Model::getDisplayedList`.

### Logic Component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

The `Logic` component:

* Receives user input and parses it.
* Interacts with the `Model` component to modify the underlying data.
* Returns feedback to the user through a `CommandResult`.

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person). Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to complete execution.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the `AddressBookParser` works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser`, where `XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name (e.g `DeleteCommandParser`).
* The newly created parser parses the user command and creates a `XYZCommand` object (e.g `DeleteCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g. `DeleteCommandParser`) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model Component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component:

* Stores the address book data (i.e. all `Contact` objects inside a `UniqueContactList` and all `Event` objects inside a `UniqueEventList`).
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate filtered list.
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate filtered list.
* Stores an `ObservableList<Displayable>` to represent the objects which need to be displayed by `UI`. When either the filtered contact list or filtered event list gets updated, this list of displayed items will be updated as well.
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* Does not depend on `Ui`, `Logic` or `Storage`.

There are 2 main types of objects in Dream Day Designer: `Contact` and `Event`.

#### `Contact`

Represents a contact within the address book. `Contact` can be either:

* **`Client`**: Clients are contacts who are hosting the weddings.
* **`Vendor`**: Vendors provide services for the wedding (e.g. catering).

#### `Event`

Represents a wedding event.

### Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component:

* Saves both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* Inherits from both `DreamDayDesignerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* Depends on `Model` since the data model of `Contact` and `Event` are defined within `Model`.

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.ddd.commons` package.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Compatibility: Should work on any mainstream OS (Windows/macOS/Linux) as long as Java `17` or above is installed.
2. Compatibility: The system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.
3. User Experience: Should be able to hold up to 1000 contacts and events without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
4. User Experience: The system should respond within two seconds.
5. User Experience: A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
6. Privacy: User data must remain on the local machine and not be shared or transmitted to any external services unless explicitly requested by the user (e.g., exporting contacts).
