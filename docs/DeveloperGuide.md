### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete John`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete John Doe")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete John Doe` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Schedule Feature

#### Overview
The `schedule` command helps to set up appointments for a client, including any relevant notes.

The sequence diagram below models the interactions between the different components of PhysioPal for the execution of the `schedule` command.

![ScheduleSequenceDiagram](images/ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Details
1. The user executes the command `schedule John Doe d/2024-10-28 1200 note/First Appointment` to schedule a new appointment for a client named john doe.
2. The `ScheduleCommandParser` object calls its `parse` method to interpret the user input.
3. A `ScheduleCommand` object is created.
4. The `ScheduleCommandParser` object returns the `ScheduleCommand` object.
5. The `LogicManager` object calls the `execute` method of `ScheduleCommand`.
6. The `execute` method then invokes the `setPerson` method of its `Model` argument to create a new appointment with the specified details.
7. The `execute` method then invokes the `updateFilteredPersonList` method of its `Model` argument to update the view of PhysioPal to show all contacts with their appointments.
8. The `execute` method returns a `CommandResult` which contains data indicating the completion of the `ScheduleCommand`.

#### Example Usage
1. User inputs the command `schedule Alice Tan d/2024-10-29 1200 note/Second Appointment`.
2. This creates an appointment for a person named "alice tan" on October 29, 2024, at 12:00pm, with the note "Second Appointment" attached.
3. The new appointment is then displayed in the UI, reflecting the updated schedule for "alice tan".

### View Client Feature

#### Overview
The `view` command enables users to access and display detailed information for a specific client in the address book.

The sequence diagram below models the interactions between the different components of PhysioPal for the execution of the `view` command.

![ViewClientSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Details
1. The user executes the command `view John Doe` to display the details of a client named john doe.
2. The `LogicManager` object receives this command and calls the `parseCommand` method of `AddressBookParser` to interpret the input.
3. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a `ViewClientCommandParser` object to handle parsing.
4. The `ViewClientCommandParser` object calls its `parse` method to extract the client name, and the `ClientUtil` utility class is used to confirm the full name "john doe."
5. The `ViewClientCommandParser` creates a `ViewClientCommand` object.
6. The `ViewClientCommandParser` returns the `ViewClientCommand` object to `AddressBookParser`, which then returns it to `LogicManager`.
7. The `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of `ViewClientCommand`.
8. The `execute` method calls `getFilteredPersonList` on the `Model` to retrieve the details of the specified client.
9. The `execute` method creates a `CommandResult` object containing the clientâ€™s information.
10. The `CommandResult` object is returned to `LogicManager`, which then displays the clientâ€™s information to the user.

#### Example Usage
1. User inputs the command `view Alice Tan`.
2. The system displays the details of "alice tan," including name, phone number, email, address, condition, reminder note and any scheduled appointments.
3. This information is shown in a pop-up or a designated UI section for easy access by the user.

### Reminder Note Feature

#### Overview
The `reminder` command helps to set a reminder note for a client's most upcoming appointment.

The reminder diagram below models the interaction between the different components of PhysioPal for the execution of the `reminder` command.

![ReminderSequenceDiagram](images/ReminderSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Details
1. The user executes the command `reminder John Doe r/1 day` to set a reminder note for a client named john doe's appointment.
2. The `ReminderCommandParser` object calls its parse method to interpret the user input.
3. A `ReminderCommand` object is created.
4. The `ReminderCommandParser` object returns the `ReminderCommand` object.
5. The `LogicManager` object calls the `execute` method of `ReminderCommand`.
6. The `execute` method then invokes the `setPerson` method of its `Model` argument to create a reminder note with the specified reminder time.
7. The `execute` method then invokes the `updateFilteredPersonList` method of its `Model` argument to update the view of PhysioPal to show all contacts with their reminders.
8. The `execute` method returns a `CommandResult` which contains data including the completion of the `ReminderCommand`.

#### Example Usage
1. User inputs the command `reminder Alice Tan r/3 hours`.
2. This creates a reminder note for a person named "alice tan", with reminder time "3 hours".
3. The reminder is then displayed in the UI, reflecting that a reminder note has been set for "alice tan"'s appointment.

### Delete Appointment Feature

#### Overview
The `appointment-delete` command helps to delete scheduled appointments for a client.

The sequence diagram below models the interactions between the different components of PhysioPal for the execution of the `appointment-delete` command.

![DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Details
1. The user executes the command `appointment-delete John Doe d/2024-10-28 1200` to delete a specified appointment for a client named john doe.
2. The `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser` object calls its `parse` method to interpret the user input.
3. A `DeleteAppointmentCommand` object is created.
4. The `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser` object returns the `DeleteAppointmentCommand` object.
5. The `LogicManager` object calls the `execute` method of `DeleteAppointmentCommand`.
6. The `execute` method then invokes the `setPerson` method of its `Model` argument to delete the specified appointment.
7. The `execute` method then invokes the `updateFilteredPersonList` method of its `Model` argument to update the view of PhysioPal to show all contacts with their appointments.
8. The `execute` method returns a `CommandResult` which contains data indicating the completion of the `DeleteAppointmentCommand`.

#### Example Usage
1. User inputs the command `appointment-delete Alice Tan d/2024-10-29 1200`.
2. This deletes the appointment for a person named "alice tan" on October 29, 2024, at 12:00pm.
3. The updated schedule for "alice tan" is then displayed in the UI.



### Listing Upcoming Appointments Feature

#### Overview

The user can view upcoming appointments through the `appointment-list` command.
The command can be supplied with optional filters date and time to list
upcoming appointments on the specified date or date and time.

Command: `appointment-list [d/DATE][TIME]`

The following sequence diagram models the interactions between the different components of PhysioPal
for the execution of `appointment-list` command.

![ListAppointmentSequenceDiagram](images/ListAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Details

1. The user executes the command `appointment-list` to view all upcoming appointments.
2. The `LogicManager` object receives this command and calls the `parseCommand` method of `AddressBookParser` to interpret the input.
3. The `AddressBookParser` then creates a `ListAppointmentsCommandParser` object to handle parsing.
4. The `ListAppointmentsCommandParser` object calls its `parse` method to extract any present date and time filters
5. The `ListAppointmentsCommandParser` creates a `ListAppointmentsCommand` object.
6. The `ListAppointmentsCommandParser` returns the `ListAppointmentsCommand` object to `AddressBookParser`, which then returns it to `LogicManager`.
7. The `LogicManager` object invokes the `execute` method of `ListAppointmentsCommand`.
8. The `execute` method calls `getFilteredPersonList` on the `Model` to retrieve the list of persons with upcoming appointments matching the filter(if any).
9. The `execute` method creates a `CommandResult` object containing the list of upcoming appointments.
10. The `CommandResult` object is returned to `LogicManager`, which then displays the list of upcoming appointments to the user.

#### Example Usage
1. User inputs the command `appointment-list`.
2. The system displays the number and list of all upcoming appointments, including notes of the appointments (if any).
3. This information is shown in the status message.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team Size - 5**

### 1. Support Multiple clients with the Same Name
**Current Feature Flaw**<br>

PhysioPal currently does not allow duplicate names, which does not reflect real-world scenarios where different clients may have identical names.

**Proposed Implementation**<br>
1. Modify the `add` command to support adding multiple clients with the same name.
   1. Exact duplicate entries (where all fields are identical) will still be disallowed.
2. Update commands to accept both `INDEX` and `NAME` formats (i.e. `COMMAND INDEX [parameters]` or `COMMAND NAME [parameters]`).
   <br> <b>Index format</b>: Each client is uniquely identified by their index.
   <br> <b>Name format</b>:
      * <b>Single Match</b>: The command executes as usual.
      * <b>Multiple Matches</b>:
         - A list of all clients with the same name is displayed.
         - Users can select the desired client by modifying the command input to include the appropriate index number.

### 2. Allow Special Characters in Names
**Current Feature Flaw**<br>

PhysioPal does not accept names with `.` , `/`, `-` or `,` which might be in a person's legal name.

**Proposed Implementation**<br>

Change the check in the add command to allow for special characters in names.

### 3. Enhance Name Display
**Current Feature Flaw**<br>

PhysioPal's UI displays all names in lowercase, which may not reflect the actual case formatting of users' names.    

**Proposed Implementation**<br>

Modify the UI to display names as they were originally entered, preserving their case formatting.

### 4. Set Reminders for Specific Appointments
**Current Feature Flaw**<br>

PhysioPal only allows reminders at the client level, limiting users to set reminders only for the next upcoming appointment. This prevents users from setting reminders for each appointment.

**Proposed Implementation**<br>
1. Modify the reminder feature to support setting reminders at the appointment level instead of just the client level.
    1. Users will be able to set a reminder for any scheduled appointment.
2. Update the command syntax to `REMINDER NAME d/DATE_AND_TIME r/REMINDER_TIME`

### 5. Enhance Reminder Feature
**Current Feature Flaw**<br>

Currently, PhysioPal sets a reminder note for clients. However, the system to send these reminders have yet to be implemented. 

**Proposed Implementation**<br>

1. Add a new "Reminders" box in PhysioPal's application interface. This box will display upcoming reminders based on the reminder times set by users.
2. Reminders are displayed in chronological order, with the soonest reminders appearing at the top of the list.
3. As reminders expire (i.e once the appointment time passes), they are automatically removed from the Reminders box.

### 6. Make Scheduling Cumulative
**Current Feature Flaw**<br>

PhysioPalâ€™s schedule command replaces a person's existing appointments with new ones, instead of adding to the current list of schedules.

**Proposed Implementation**<br>

Update the schedule command to append new appointments to the existing list of schedules for a person. Specifically:

1. Retrieve the current schedules of the person.
2. Validate for any duplicate or conflicting time slots.
3. Append the new schedules to the existing ones.

### 7. Make 'Empty Note in Schedule' Error Message More Specific
**Current Feature Flaw**<br>

The current error message for an empty note in the schedule command `Invalid command format!
schedule: Schedule appointments for client. Parameters: NAME d/DATE_AND_TIME... note/NOTE...
Example: schedule John Doe d/2024-10-17 1200 note/first appointment` is too general.

**Proposed Implementation**<br>

Update the error message to specifically indicate that the note cannot be empty: The note field cannot be empty. Please provide a note for the appointment.

### 8. Validate No-Change Edits in Edit Command
**Current Feature Flaw**<br>

Currently, if a user calls the `edit` command but does not change any information (e.g they enter the same values for all fields), PhysioPal still returns a success message.

**Proposed Implementation**<br>
1. Update the `edit` command to check if the new input values are identical to the existing data.
2. If no changes are detected, an error message will be displayed, such as `No changes detected. Please enter different values to update the record.`.

### 9. Enable Information Wrapping in Client Window
**Current Feature Flaw**  

PhysioPal currently truncates long client details (address, email, name, and medical condition) in the client window, limiting readability.

**Proposed Implementation**

1. Modify `ClientWindow` to enable wrapping for long fields, ensuring full details are visible across multiple lines.
2. Use `Text` or `TextArea` components with word-wrapping for address, email, and medical condition fields. The name field will also wrap if it exceeds the header width.

### 10. Add 'Appointment Date In The Past' Prompt Message

**Current Feature Flaw**

PhysioPal currently does not have an error message or prompt when the user tries to use `appointment-list` with a date and time
filter that was in the past (i.e. after the current local system time) and displays `Listed 0 upcoming appointments.`. <br>
Hence the user may be confused as to why no appointments are returned on a past appointment date.

**Proposed Implementation**

1. Modify `appointment-list` command to detect that given date and time filter is in the past.
2. Other than displaying `Listed 0 upcoming appointments.`, display in a new line to inform the user that
`Date and Time you have given are in the past. I am designed to display only upcoming appointments.`.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Project Overview

Our project aims to provide an efficient contact management system for a physiotherapist 
with a large client base, building on AddressBook Level 3 (AB3). Additional features include scheduling appointments,
setting reminder notes, tracking patient appointments, type, and payment. These improvements are
aimed to provide a cost-effective solution to help physiotherapists save time, money and manpower on
repetitive tasks.

### Difficulty Level and Challenges Faced

Developing PhysioPal presented unique challenges. Unlike AB3,
which handles only one entity type, PhysioPal extends heavily on the appointment feature: `Schedule`.
The need for seamless interaction between different entities and satisfying functionality requirements
demanded significant work to incorporate features such as reminder notes and appointment handling.
Furthermore, the pop-up window to display client details in an organized fashion added complexity
to the UI design.

Entity Management and Interaction: Handling multiple interdependent entities added complexity
in data storage and retrieval, along with maintaining consistent UI updates.
Error Management in Scheduling: Validating date and time inputs for appointments, 
especially in cases of overlaps and conflicts, required custom validation logic and extensive testing.
State Persistence Across Sessions: Ensuring that scheduled appointments and 
client information persist across sessions added layers of complexity to the storage component.

### Effort Required

The effort required for PhysioPal was extensive, encompassing phases of analysis,
design, development, testing, and documentation. The multidisciplinary team dedicated considerable
time and resources to understand the application's architecture, pinpoint areas for improvement, 
and implement new features while maintaining compatibility and stability. 
Utilizing Agile methodologies allowed the team to address challenges iteratively and integrate
stakeholder feedback throughout, leading to a streamlined and effective development process.


### Achievements

PhysioPal was able to achieve many milestones despite the difficulties faced. 
This majorly enhanced the contact management systemâ€™s functionality to be more tailored
to physiotherapists. Key achievements included:

1. Streamlined Contact Removal (delete): The delete command enables physiotherapists to 
remove a client by name instead of an ID, simplifying the process and reducing errors. 
This approach allows quick removal of inactive clients.

2. Enhanced Appointment Scheduling and Management (schedule, appointment-delete, appointment-list):
The schedule command allows quick setup of client appointments with date, time, and contextual notes,
ensuring well-prepared sessions. appointment-delete provides flexibility to cancel appointments by
name and time, preventing scheduling conflicts. appointment-list offers an overview of 
upcoming sessions, helping to manage and organize appointments effectively.

3. Effective Reminder Management (reminder and reminder-delete): The reminder command allows 
physiotherapists to set a reminder note in terms of hours and days before appointments, 
ensuring punctuality and reducing the risk of missed sessions. reminder-delete allows for easy 
removal of outdated reminders, providing flexibility. Together, these features help maintain a 
well-organized schedule, enhancing the client experience.

4. Integrated Payment Tracking (payment): The payment command marks specific appointments as paid, 
simplifying billing and ensuring financial clarity. By tracking payment status per appointment, 
this feature minimizes errors and reduces administrative workload. It provides a clear payment
record linked to each clientâ€™s treatment.

5. Focused Client Information Display (view Command with Pop-Up): The view command opens a pop-up 
with comprehensive client details, including contact info, appointments, reminder notes, and 
payment status. This consolidated view improves accessibility, allowing physiotherapists to 
quickly review all necessary client information. It streamlines workflow and supports a more 
personalized client experience.

### Effort Saved Through Reuse

For our project, approximately 10% of the effort was saved through reusing AB3's existing codebase.
Features such as adding and deleting contact were adapted from the existing implementation
to fit our users' needs.
