## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The _**Architecture Diagram**_ given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14B-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tahub/contacts/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14B-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tahub/contacts/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14B-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tahub/contacts/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14B-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tahub/contacts/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14B-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tahub/contacts/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("person-delete m/A1234570L")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/PersonDeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `person-delete m/A1234570L` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `PersonDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `PersonDeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `PersonDeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14B-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tahub/contacts/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the enrollment data i.e: all `StudentCourseAssociation` objects contained in a `StudentCourseAssociationList` object
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Course component

API: [`Course.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14B-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tahub/contacts/model/course/Course.java)

<puml src="diagrams/CourseClassDiagram.puml" width="300" />

The `Course` component,

* stores the course data i.e., all `Course` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCourseList` object).

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14B-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/tahub/contacts/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data, user preference data and enrollment data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage` and `StudentCourseAssociationListStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tahub.contacts.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `person-delete m/A1234570L` command to delete the person with matriculation number A1234570L in the address book. The `person-delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `person-delete m/A1234570L` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `person-add m/A1234570L n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `person-add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `person-delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

      (In this case, the _student_ object with matriculation number A2345678Y and the _course_
       object with course code MA1521 must already be created.)

   2. Test case: `enroll m/A2345678Y c/MA1521 tut/T17`

       Expected: The student with matriculation number A2345678Y is enrolled into tutorial T17 of the course MA1521. A success message will be shown to the user.

   3. Test case: `enroll m/A2345678Y c/MA1521 tut/T17` (_again_)

       Expected: An error message will be displayed to the user and no new enrollment will occur.

2. Enrolling an existing student into an invalid course on TAHub

    1. Prerequisites: Ensure that a _student_ object has been created but a course with course code _CS3233_ has not been created

    2. Test case: `enroll m/A2345678Y c/CHUNITHM tut/T17`

        Expected: An error message will be displayed to the user and no enrollment will occur as the course code entered has an invalid format.

    3. Test case: `enroll m/A2345678Y c/CS3233 tut/T17`

   a valid tutorial of the course. (In this case, the student object with matriculation number A0286651Y, the course
   object with course code MA1521 must already be created and the student must be enrolled in tutorial T17)
    2. Test case: `attend-present m/A0286651Y c/MA1521 tut/T17` <br>
Expected: Student marked present. Success message shown.

2. Marking students as absent
    1. Prerequisites: Ensure that both student and course objects have been created and the student is enrolled into
       a valid tutorial of the course. (In this case, the student object with matriculation number A0286651Y, the course
       object with course code MA1521 must already be created and the student must be enrolled in tutorial T17)

   2. Test case: **missing** file(s) - delete one or more of the `.json` files in `./data` <br>
      **Expected**: TAHub Contacts automatically loads a set of sample data to replace the missing data.
      (This behavior is meant to be used for loading sample data when first running the program)
   3. Test case: **corrupted** file(s) - corrupt one or more of the `.json` files in `./data`,
      for instance, by deleting the trailing `}` and invalidating the JSON format. <br>
      **Expected**: TAHub Contacts loads with empty data.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

1. Add a `course-list` command to list all courses so that user can view courses in the system.
2. Add support for more Tutorial IDs by changing the regular expressions (i.e:`VALIDATION_REGEX`) used to accommodate other valid tutorial ids (e.g: T01A).
3. Modify all commands that takes in `m/MATRICULATION_NUMBER` to allow option of accepting index of the person in the list.
4. The `NAME` attribute for person shall have a maximum length of 50 characters.
5. Add an `attendance` (or similar) command that opens the Attendance window instead of using a mouse to click the `Attendance` button.
6. Add more detailed error messages that tell the user specifically what fields are missing instead of simply "required fields are missing"
7. Modify enroll/unenroll commands to not allow the same student to join multiple tutorials of the same course.
