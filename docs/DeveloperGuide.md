### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student`, `Consultation` & `Lesson` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here is a fuller diagram of how the `Logic` component might interact with adjacent classes:

<img src="images/FullerLogicClassDiagram.png"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the address book data i.e., all `Consultation` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueConsultList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Consultation` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Consultation>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the address book data i.e., all `Lesson` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueLessonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Lesson` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Lesson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Course` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Course` object per unique Course, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Course` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Consultation Management

The consultation management feature enables TAs to schedule and manage consultation sessions with students. This section describes the implementation details of the consultation system.

#### Architecture

The consultation feature comprises these key components:

* `Consultation`: Core class representing a consultation session
* `Date`: Represents and validates consultation dates
* `Time`: Represents and validates consultation times
* `AddConsultCommand`: Handles adding new consultations
* `AddConsultCommandParser`: Parses user input for consultation commands

The class diagram below shows the structure of the consultation feature:

<img src="images/Consultation/ConsultCommands.png" width="450" />

#### Implementation

The consultation management system is implemented through several key mechanisms:

**1. Date and Time Validation**

The system enforces strict validation for consultation scheduling:
* Dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and represent valid calendar dates
* Times must be in 24-hour `HH:mm` format
* Both use Java's built-in `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` for validation

Example:
```java
Date date = new Date("2024-10-20"); // Valid
Time time = new Time("14:00");      // Valid
Date invalidDate = new Date("2024-13-45"); // Throws IllegalArgumentException
```

**2. Consultation Management**

The `Consultation` class manages:
* Immutable date and time properties
* Thread-safe student list management
* Equality based on date, time, and enrolled students

Core operations:
```java
// Creating a consultation
Consultation consult = new Consultation(date, time, students);

// Adding/removing students
consult.addStudent(student);
consult.removeStudent(student);

// Getting immutable student list
List<Student> students = consult.getStudents(); // Returns unmodifiable list
```
The sequence diagram below shows how the `addStudent(student)` method is performed in the `Consultation` class.

<img src="images/Consultation/addStudent_for_consult.png" width="450" />

The command first checks if the student is already in the consultation. If the student was already in the consultation, and exception is thrown and the student is not added.

However, if the student was not previously in the consultation, the student is now added to the list of students in the consultation.

**3. Command Processing**

The system supports these consultation management commands:
- `addconsult`: Creates new consultation sessions
- `addtoconsult`: Adds students to existing consultations
- `deleteconsult`: Removes consultation sessions
- `removefromconsult`: Removes students from consultations

Command examples:
```
addconsult d/2024-10-20 t/14:00
addtoconsult 1 n/John Doe i/3
deleteconsult 1
removefromconsult 1 n/John Doe
```
The sequence diagram below shows how the command `addtoconsult 1 n/John Doe i/3` is executed.

<img src="images/Consultation/SequenceDiagramAddToConsultCommand.png" />

The commands for Consultations are executed using the `Logic` component:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `AddToConsultCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (in this case, the `AddToConsultCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student to the consultation).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.


**Aspect 1: Date and Time Representation**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Separate `Date` and `Time` classes
    * Pros: Clear separation of concerns, focused validation
    * Cons: Two objects to manage instead of one

* **Alternative 2**: Combined `DateTime` class
    * Pros: Unified handling of temporal data
    * Cons: More complex validation, reduced modularity

**Aspect 2: Student List Management**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Immutable view with mutable internal list
    * Pros: Thread-safe external access, flexible internal updates
    * Cons: Complex implementation

* **Alternative 2**: Fully immutable list
    * Pros: Simpler thread-safety
    * Cons: Higher memory usage for modifications

### Lesson Management

The lesson management feature enables TAs to schedule and manage lessons with students. This section describes the implementation details of the lesson system.

#### Architecture

The lesson feature comprises these key components:

* `Lesson`: Core class representing a lessons
* `Date`: Represents and validates lesson dates
* `Time`: Represents and validates lesson times
* `StudentLessonInfo`: Represents student info used for lessons. This includes the student's attendance and participation score for a lesson.
* `AddLessonCommand`: Handles adding new lessons
* `AddLessonCommandParser`: Parses user input for `AddLessonCommand`

The class diagram below shows the structure of the lesson feature:

<img src="images/Lessons/LessonsAndRelatedCommands.png" width="450" />

#### Implementation

The lesson management system is implemented through several key mechanisms:

**1. Date and Time Validation**

The system enforces strict validation for lesson scheduling:
* Dates must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format and represent valid calendar dates
* Times must be in 24-hour `HH:mm` format
* Both use Java's built-in `LocalDate` and `LocalTime` for validation

Example:
```java
Date date = new Date("2024-10-20"); // Valid
Time time = new Time("14:00");      // Valid
Date invalidDate = new Date("2024-13-45"); // Throws IllegalArgumentException
```

**2. Lesson Management**

The `Lesson` class manages:
* Immutable date and time properties
* Thread-safe student information list management
* Equality based on date, time, and student information

Core operations:
```java
// Creating a lesson
Lesson lesson = new Lesson(date, time, studentLessonInfoList);

// Adding/removing students
lesson.addStudent(student);
lesson.removeStudent(student);

// Setting attendance
lesson.setAttendance(student, attendance);

// Setting pariticipation score
lesson.setParticipation(student, participationScore);

// Getting immutable student info list, returns unmodifiable list
List<StudentLessonInfo> studentInfoList = lesson.getStudentLessonInfoList(); 
```

**3. Command Processing**

The system supports these lesson management commands:
- `addlesson`: Creates new lesson
- `addtolesson`: Adds students to existing lesson
- `deletelesson`: Removes lesson
- `listlessons`: Lists all lessons
- `removefromlesson`: Removes students from lesson
- `marka`: Marks the attendance of  students in a lesson (can mark as present or absent)
- `markp`: Sets the participation score of students in a lesson

Command examples:
```
addlesson d/2024-10-20 t/14:00
addtolesson 1 n/John Doe i/3
deletelesson 1
removefromlesson 1 n/John Doe
markp 1 n/John Doe pt/25
marka 1 n/John Doe n/Jane Doe a/y
```
The sequence diagram below shows how the command `addtolesson 1 n/John Doe i/3` is executed.

<img src="images/Lessons/SequenceDiagramAddToLessonCommand.png" />

The commands for Lessons are executed using the `Logic` component, making it similar to the sequence diagram in the consultation section above.

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `AddToLessonCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (in this case, the `AddToLessonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student to the lesson).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.


The next sequence diagram shows how the `MarkLessonAttendanceCommand` is executed to update the attendance of students in a lesson.

<img src="images/Lessons/MarkAttendanceCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

The flow of the program when `MarkLessonAttendanceCommand.execute` is called is as follows:

1. When the execute method is called, the command first gets the `targetLesson` from the model.
2. The command then creates a new `Lesson` object (called `newLesson`) from the `targetLesson`. This creates a copy of the current `targetLesson`.
3. Now, for each student, the command sets the student's attendance using the `setAttendance` method in the `Lesson` class.
4. Finally, the command replaces the `targetLesson` in the model with the `newLesson`.


**Aspect 1: Date and Time Representation**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Separate `Date` and `Time` classes
  * Pros: Clear separation of concerns, focused validation
  * Cons: Two objects to manage instead of one

* **Alternative 2**: Combined `DateTime` class
  * Pros: Unified handling of temporal data
  * Cons: More complex validation, reduced modularity

**Aspect 2: StudentInfo List Management**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Immutable view with mutable internal list
  * Pros: Thread-safe external access, flexible internal updates
  * Cons: Complex implementation

* **Alternative 2**: Fully immutable list
  * Pros: Simpler thread-safety
  * Cons: Higher memory usage for modifications


### Data Import / Export Feature

The import/export feature allows TAs to archive and transfer their data in CSV format. This functionality is implemented for both students and consultations.

#### Implementation

The feature is implemented through four main command classes:
* `ExportCommand`: Exports student data to CSV
* `ExportConsultCommand`: Exports consultation data to CSV
* `ImportCommand`: Imports student data from CSV
* `ImportConsultCommand`: Imports consultation data from CSV

Export File Handling:
* Files are always saved in the `data` directory first as the primary storage location
* The command then attempts to copy the file to the user's home directory as a backup 
* If the home directory copy fails, the command still succeeds with only the data directory file 
* The -f flag allows overwriting of existing files in both locations 
* Filenames are restricted to alphanumeric characters to prevent path traversal attacks and ensure cross-platform compatibility

Import File Resolution:

The system searches for import files in this priority order to balance security and convenience:
* Data directory (./data/) - primary application storage
* Current directory - for convenience during testing/development
* Home directory paths (with ~) - for user convenience
* Absolute paths - for flexibility in file locations

Each export command follows this workflow:
1. Validates filename input (must be alphanumeric))
2. Creates `data` directory if needed
3. Writes data to CSV in `data` directory
4. Copies file to home directory if possible
5. Handles file overwrite with force flag (-f)
6. Returns success with one or both file paths

Each import command follows this workflow:
1. Resolves file path using priority order:
   - Data directory (./data/)
   - Current directory
   - Home directory paths (with ~)
   - Absolute paths
2. Validates file exists and is readable
3. Parses CSV header
4. Process entries line by line
5. Logs invalid entries to `error.csv`

Example sequences:
```
Student CSV format:
Name,Phone,Email,Courses
John Doe,12345678,john@example.com,CS2103T;CS2101

Consultation CSV format:
Date,Time,Students
2024-10-20,14:00,John Doe;Jane Doe
```

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: File Format**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: CSV format
    * Pros: Widely compatible, human-readable, easy to edit
    * Cons: Limited structure, requires careful escaping
* **Alternative 2**: JSON format
    * Pros: Maintains data structure, less escaping needed
    * Cons: Less human-readable, harder to edit manually

**Aspect: Error Handling**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Log errors to separate file
    * Pros: Clear error reporting, allows partial imports
    * Cons: Requires managing separate error log file
* **Alternative 2**: Fail entire import on any error
    * Pros: Ensures data consistency
    * Cons: Less flexible, requires perfect input

**Aspect: Export File Location**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Dual location with strict filenames
    * Pros: Convenient access, automatic backup
    * Cons: More complex validation, potential sync issues
* **Alternative 2**: Single location with flexible paths
    * Pros: Simpler implementation, more user control
    * Cons: Manual backup required


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `liststudents`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `liststudents`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The system should be able to scale to accommodate a growing number of users (teachers, TAs, students) without requiring significant reengineering.
5. The platform should have a clean, intuitive user interface that allows new users to complete basic tasks (like searching for a student) with minimal training.
6. Any search query should return results within 1 second for up to 10,000 student records.
7. Product should be for a single user.
8. The data should be stored locally and should be in a human editable text file.
9. The software should work without requiring an installer.

### Planned Enhancements

**<u>Make command names case-insensitive</u>**

**Description**

Make command names case-insensitive, i.e. `Find` is safe to substitute for
`find` in the `find` command.

**Rationale**

Users may make small mistakes in capitalisation when typing quickly.
It can save time to ensure minor mistakes such as these in the command keyword
(not the arguments) will not prevent the command from working.

**<u>Allow students with same name to be added</u>**

**Description**

Allow students with the same name to be added (still case-sensitive).<br>
Instead, disallow students with the same **phone number** or **email address** to be added.<br>
Commands that currently use student **names** as arguments should instead use their **index**
in the student list.

**Rationale**

It is arguably rarer for students to share a phone number or email address (university email?) with
another student than it is to share a name.

**<u>Allow more commands to use student index instead of full name</u>**

**Description**

Currently, some commands such as `marka` and `markp` require the user to type
out the full name of the student.<br>
Instead, change it so that they use the student's index in the student list, similar to commands
like `addtolesson`.

**Rationale**

Under normal conditions, it is impossible for a consultation or lesson to have a student
that is not in the student list. Thus, it is safe to specify students by their index
in the student list.<br>
Additionally, doing so is faster to type.

**<u>Allow certain special characters to be used in names</u>**

**Description**

Allow more special characters such as `/` and `-` to be used in student names.

**Rationale**

It is possible for students' legal names to contain `-` (e.g. Mary-Ann) or `/` (e.g. S/O).
Relaxing current restrictions to allow such characters will allow such names to be input.

**<u>Add clearer error message for integers/indexes </u>**

**Description**

Currently, when an invalid or sufficiently large number is given as an index, the error message says:<br>
Index is not an unsigned non-zero integer.
This should be changed to specify the requirement that indexes should be between
1 and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

**Rationale**

The current error message can be confusing for non-technical users who do not know what
*unsigned* means, and misleading when it also shows for large inputs that exceed Java's
integer limit, such as `104890385925902379`.
Clearer error messages can help to mitigate such confusion.

**<u>Make `find c/` throw an error</u>**

**Description**

Currently, `find c/` does not throw an error. Instead, it runs successfully but always
returns 0 students.
This should be changed so an appropriate error message is shown (courses cannot be empty).

**Rationale**

A user might expect `find c/` to find students who are taking no courses.
However, this is not the case, and will result in confusion.<br>
Hence, this command should not execute successfully.

**<u>Make participation not accept + before the number</u>**

**Description**

Currently, the participation argument in the `markp` command accepts the use of `+` before it,
i.e. `+3` is treated as `3`.
This should be treated as an invalid format.

**Rationale**

Though not strictly wrong, the index parser currently already checks for `+` and treats it as invalid.
For consistency, this should also apply to participation.

**<u>Make year 0000 an illegal value for the date</u>**

**Description**

Currently, year 0000 is accepted as a valid year.
This should be changed to no longer be valid.

**Rationale**

According to Wikipedia, a year 0 does not exist in the Anno Domini calendar year.
Therefore, it should not be allowed.

**<u>Standardise error messages involving index</u>**

**Description**

For some commands, entering specific indexes (like 0) will show an error message
stating that the index is invalid (not an unsigned nonzero integer), while other times
it will show the default error message for incorrect format.

**Rationale**

These error messages should be standardised to avoid confusion.
Any errors when parsing the index specifically ideally should specify that the index
specifically is invalid to help the user correct it.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. If you encounter an unexpected empty TAHub (no students, consults or lessons) upon startup or your data
is replaced by sample data, your data file may be corrupted.
   2. If you wish to try and salvage your data, **do not** perform any command yet. **This will overwrite your data.**
   3. Copy your data file to make a safe backup first, and rename it something other than `addressbook`. You can open
this file to view your data in JSON format.
   4. TAHub will generate a new data file with sample data. In the meantime, if you are experienced
with JSON, you can attempt to recover your data file by fixing issues in the file, usually syntax/formatting.

### Exporting data

   Expected: Error message about invalid filename characters.

4. Test case: `export students` (when students.csv already exists)<br>
   Expected: Error message suggesting force flag usage.

5. Test case: `export -f students`<br>
   Expected: Existing file overwritten. Success message shows number of students exported.

#### Exporting consultation data
1. Prerequisites: List all consultations using the `listconsults` command. Multiple consultations should be in the list.

2. Test case: `exportconsult sessions`<br>
   Expected: CSV file created with consultation data. Success message shows number of consultations exported.

3. Test case: `exportconsult sessions` (when file exists)<br>
   Expected: Error message suggesting force flag usage.

4. Other incorrect export commands to try: `exportconsult`, `exportconsult /test`, `exportconsult test.csv`<br>
   Expected: Error messages about invalid format/filename.
