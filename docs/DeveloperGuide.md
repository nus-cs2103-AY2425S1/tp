  * It was used to generate the first two test cases in RemoveGradeCommandParserTest.java, MarkCommandParserTest.java & MarkCommandTest.java.
  * It was also used for the usage of `.getStyleClass()` & `.add()` methods in PersonCard.java to display the information clearly.
  * It was consulted to get a plan of how `PersonComparator` can be implemented.
  * It was consulted to fix and improve the UI.

## **Design**


### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete n/John`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.


For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

{{ newPage }}

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

{{ newPage }}

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

{{ newPage }}

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete n/John")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

{{ newPage }}

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.


Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>


How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

{{ newPage }}

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the KonTActs data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

{{ newPage }}

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both KonTActs data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

---

### Add contacts

**Overview**

The `add` command allows user to add students' contact into KonTActs.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the logic component handles the user input.

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

Note: While the diagram shows the lifeline of objects even after their deletion, this is a limitattion of plantUML.

**Details**

1. The user inputs "add n/John tele/@John g/Johnny e/John@test.com". (Not shown in diagram)
2. The `LogicManager` object will be called to `execute` the input.
3. The `AddressBookParser` will identify the type of command is `AddCommand`, before creating a `AddCommandParser` to parse the details.
4. The `AddCommandParser` will `parse` the `USER_DETAILS` before creating a `AddCommand`.
5. The new `AddCommand` will be returned to `LogicManager`.
6. The `LogicManager` will then calls `exectute` on `AddCommand` while providing the model.
7. This causes the `AddCommand` to call the `addPerson` method of model, adding the person to the model.
8. A `CommandResult` object is subsequently created which indicates the success of `AddCommand`.

**Example Usage**
1. User inputs the command "add n/Tom tele/@Tom g/Tommy e/Tom@test.com".
2. KonTActs will create a contact of Tom with the given details before adding it to the contact list.
3. The contact is then displayed in the UI, along with a success message.

---

### Add Grade implementation

**Logic**: 
1. `AddGradeCommand.java`
2. `AddGradeCommandParser.java`

The `addGrade` command is used by KonTActs to add an assignment and grade to a contact.
The added assignments and grades uses `HashMap` to store the assignments and grades in each person object.

This is illustrated in the activity diagram below:

<puml src="diagrams/AddGradeImpl.puml" width="450" />

* addGrade checks whether the assignment exists in the database, if the score is valid and if the person exists in the contacts.
* If the conditions are satisfied, the assignment is added to the `HashMap` in the person object which stores all the added assignments of that person.

---

### MarkCommand

<puml src="diagrams/MarkCommandActivityDiagram.puml" width="750" />


* The `MarkCommand` is used by KonTActs to allow TAs to mark the attendance for a student.
* It follows the activity diagram as shown above where it first checks if the person exists.
* If the person exists, it will check if the weeksPresent contains the week to be marked.
* If the weeksPresent does not contain the week to be marked yet, it will add it in and return a success message. Else it will throw a mark already success message to tell the TA that the attendance for the TA for that week has been marked.

**Example Usage**
1. User inputs the command "mark n/John Doe w/1".
2. KonTActs will set the week 1 attendance for John Doe to be true.
3. The update is then displayed in the UI, along with a success message.

---

### Export Command implementation
**API** [`Export.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Export.java)

The `ExportCommand` is used by KonTActs to allow users to export contact data as a CSV file that can be
easily shared or imported. The ExportCommand operates on the existing list of contacts and
exports them to the specified file location.

- The command validates the file path and handle any errors during the export process.
- Error message will be displayed if any errors are encountered.
- ExportCommand retrieves all contact data from KonTActs and formats the data it into a CSV file.
- After the export is completed (file is saved at desired location), a confirmation message will be displayed.

A visual representation is shown below of how a typical user might use the `ExportCommand`,


<puml src="diagrams/Export.puml" width="550"></puml>

---

### Command History implementation
**API** : [`CommandHistory.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/CommandHistory.java)

The `CommandHistory` is used by KonTActs to allow users to navigate and retrieve previous inputted commands. It follows a singleton pattern where only a single instance can be created.

- `CommandHistory` makes use of an `ArrayList` to store the commands of the current user session.
- The `ArrayList` is destroyed at the end of the program and a new one will be created at the start of every session of KonTActs.
- An `index` points to the current command displayed in the command box of the Graphical user interface (GUI).

When a user enters a command,
1. If an existing `CommandHistory` instance already exists, then the command will be added to it
2. Else, a new `CommandHistory` instance will be instantiated and the command will be added to it

This is illustrated in the activity diagram below:
<center>
<puml src="diagrams/commandHistoryActivityDiagram.puml" width="450" />
</center>

When a user retrieves a command that was previously executed using <kbd>â†‘</kbd> or <kbd>â†“</kbd>,
- `CommandHistory` instance first checks if there are fields in the `ArrayList` of the `CommandHistory` instance.
- `CommandHistory` instance then checks for the correct `index`. (i.e. The `index` is valid when it is between 0 and the size of the `ArrayList`).

If both conditions are satisfied, the `ArrayList` is accessed with the `index` and the command string (that was previously entered) will be returned and displayed on the command box of the GUI.

A visual representation is shown below of how a typical user might use the `CommandHistory`,

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team member count: 5

1. **Implement commands to add/edit assignment details:** Currently, one has to edit the `kontacts.json` file manually to add or remove assignment details. This could be an issue as the information keyed in may be incorrect. We are planning to create commands which can add/edit assignment details (such as assignment name `Ex04` and its respective `maxGrade` fields) to the `assignment.json` file. This is to make the adding/editing of new assignments easier and prevent wrong information being entered.
2. **Include validation for Telegram ID:** Currently, KonTActs does not check for the Telegram ID's length despite it not being a valid username in Telegram. In future updates, we are planning to provide proper Telegram ID validation to prevent users from inputting usernames that are not accepted by Telegram.
3. **Add flexibility to attendance:** Currently, the maximum number of weeks that can be inputted is 14 since there are 14 weeks in a semester (from week 0 to week 13). However, it is possible that the user would want to use it for a different amount of weeks such as during special terms. Thus, we plan on incorporating commands to edit the start or end week of the attendance.
4. **Improve UI of Result Display box:** Currently, the Result Display only shows three lines of message to the user. However, some of the details require more than three lines to be seen. We plan to improve the UI such that users are able to adjust the size of the Result Display box to display more information.
5. **Improve scroll-ability of application:** Currently, when there is a long tag, and the View Window is closed, the scroll of the application does not work. Although there is a [workaround](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t11-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#known-issues) to it, it is not efficient and prevents fast usage. So, we plan on editing the View Window and the Main Window to make it more user-friendly.
