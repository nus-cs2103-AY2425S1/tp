### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `TagList` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic Component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is another sequence diagram, taking `execute("tag 1 t/friends")` API call as example.
![[Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `tag 1 t/friends` Command]](images/TagSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `TagCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`, `TagCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`, `TagCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `TagCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`, `TagCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.


Diving into specific implementation of the `XYZCommand` and `XYZCommandParser` classes, the user command undergoes extensive checks for validity.
Demonstrating with an example, the following activity diagrams summarise what happens when a user executes a `newtag` and `tag` command:
![NewTagActivityDiagram.png](images%2FNewTagActivityDiagram.png)
![TagActivityDiagram.png](images%2FTagActivityDiagram.png)

These extensive input checks in the Logic classes protect against potential malicious and invalid inputs that could undermine the usage of the code.

The class diagram below provides an overview of Command.

<img src="images/CommandClassDiagram.png"/>

Commands that extends the UndoableCommand class have a concrete implementation of `undo`, which is called during the execution of an UndoCommand. During the execution of an `UndoableCommand`, the changes to the guest list are stored, and will be used for `undo`.

### Model Component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the current list of tags as an `ObservableList<Tag>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. This allows `AddessBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores a `Command` object that represents the user's last executed command.


### Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Augment undo, add redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

Currently, the undo feature facilitated by the class `UndoCommand`. It is implemented by having an abstract class `UndoableCommand`, which the command extends, proving a concrete implementation of `UndoableCommand#undo()`. and is implemented by having an undo method under each command, which implements an `UndoableCommand` interface. It does not utilise saved states of the address book.

The proposed augmented undo and new redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 (current implementation):** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Planned Enhancements**

In the current v1.6 iteration, we are aware of certain feature flaws and possible areas for improvements. Below are some of the upcoming works scheduled to be addressed.<br>

### Fix `filter`, `add` and `undo` commands
Currently, running any `filter` command that changes the list displayed, followed by an `add` command that successfully adds a guest changes the displayed list to the full guest list as intended.<br>
However, the filters inside the filter panel are not removed, which can hinder users from performing filter functions.<br>
This would also imply that the `undo` command does not operate as intended after the `add` command.<br>
A workaround is to run the command `list` to reset the filters after adding a guest.

### Standardise tag colours
The intention to differentiate tags by colours was to enable users to distinguish tags easily.<br>
Currently, the colour of the tags changes randomly everytime the app is reopened.<br>
We understand that experienced users may associate certain colours to certain tags. Thus, we plan to map each tag to a fixed colour, ensuring a standardised tag colour everytime the app is used.

### Rigorous checks on user inputs
Currently, fields like `Phone` accepts only 8 digits, but does not check whether the starting digit is a 6, 8, or 9 (in compliance with Singapore's phone numbers).<br>
Other commands such as `newtag 1 t/friends` will successfully create a new tag called `friends` while ignoring the redundant input `1`.<br>
To provide clarity and ease to users, we plan to have more rigorous checks and display clearer messages to the user. For the latter example, "The input '1' is ignored."

### Empty fields for `Email` and `Phone`
We understand that not both fields are always required. Users can contact guests either through phone or email.<br>
Hence, we plan to only require one of the two fields to be inputted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product Scope

**Target user profile**: 

Wedding planners who
* needs to manage a significant number (50-100) of wedding guests
* only have guests with Singapore phone numbers
* only needs to plan 1 wedding at a time
* prefer desktop applications over other types (e.g. Web-based)
* can type fast
* much prefers typing to cursor interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using Command Line Interface (CLI) applications

**Value proposition**:
Reduce the time taken to add, tag and filter guests, allowing planners to focus more time on other wedding needs.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 100 guests without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Should only be able to support one wedding event at a time.
5.  Should load the list of guests in under 3 seconds, even when _filtering_ the list.
6.  GUI should be intuitive and easy to learn for wedding planners to manage the guest list.
7.  Guest list should be saved and updated throughout uses.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **GUI**: Graphical User Interface allows users to interact with the address book codebase through visual representation
* **CLI**: Command Line Interface accepts text input to execute functions of the application
* **JAR file**: A package file that contains many class files, associated metadata and resources that build the application
* **RSVP status**: A field on each guest that indicates if the guest has responded, attending or not attending the wedding, which can be used for filtering purposes

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder.
   
   1. Open a command terminal in your computer.

   1. `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in (e.g If the jar file is stored in `/Desktop/TestFile`, then the command should be `cd /Desktop/TestFile`).
   
   1. Use the `java -jar ab3myguest.jar` command to run the application. Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Creating a tag

1. Creating a tag
    
   1. Prerequisites: Tag list contains less than 30 tags. Tag `family` does not exist while `friends` does.

   1. Test case: `newtag t/family`<br>
      Expected: Tag `family` is created and shown in the tag list. Details of the created tag shown in the status message.

   1. Test case: `newtag t/friends`<br>
      Expected: No tag is created. Error details shown in the status message.

   1. Other incorrect `newtag` commands to try: `newtag`, `newtag t/`, `newtag t/x` (where x is a non-ASCII character)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Tip:** When utilising the application, it is recommended to occasionally duplicate the data file to an empty folder independent of the application as a backup, in case of missing or corrupted data files.
</div>

1. Dealing with corrupted data files
   1. Run the JAR file and note the error message for the corrupted data file
   2. Open the project using an IDE (recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA)
   2. Navigate to `/data` folder
   3. Open the JSON file inside, it should be named `ab3myguest.json`
   4. Edit the file to fix the corrupted data
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Important:** Editing the data file directly is dangerous and could cause more issues. Do it with discretion and only as a last resort.
</div>

2. Dealing with missing data files
   1. Open the project using an IDE (recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA)
   2. Navigate to `/data` folder
   3. Open the JSON file inside, it should be named `ab3myguest.json`
   4. If there is none, you can copy the default data file from our [code space](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp)
