## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

    1. Prerequisites: List all events using the `list -e` command. Event with name `Study` with start date `Jan 01 2025`, end date `Jan 01 2025`, location `School` already exists.

    1. Test case: `event -n Study -sd 2025-01-01 -ed 2025-01-01 -l School`
       Expected: `This event already exists in the event book` is displayed.

### Saving data

**Dealing with missing/corrupted data files**

1. **Scenario:** Missing data files (i.e. `addressbook.json` and `eventbook.json`).
   * This can be simulated by deleting the data files.
   * **Expected Behavior:** LegacyLink starts with the sample contacts and sample event, with the new data files being automatically created.
2. **Scenario:** Corrupted data files (i.e. `addressbook.json` and `eventbook.json`).
   * This can be simulated by modifying the data files to contain malformed data.
   * **Expected Behavior:** LegacyLink starts with empty event and contact books.


## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level
Compared to AddressBook 3 (AB3), LegacyLink introduces events creation and management. Our project integrates both Person and Event, each with unique attributes and interdependencies, which requires more complex data models and more flexible UI components to them. 

### Challenges Faced
1. **UI Flexibility:** We required a UI that could dynamically adapt based on the results of user commands, allowing for contextually relevant displays that update in real time. For instance, when updating the events attended by a given person, we had to ensure that the updated details are also reflected on the detailed view of the person. This required a deeper understanding of JavaFXâ€™s features, such as dynamic pane switching, conditional rendering, and event-driven updates, which many of us are unfamiliar with.

2. **Brownfield development**: Since AB3 is already a functional product with a range of features, we had to understand the codebase and build upon it. This means that all of us have to have a good understanding of each component and its dependencies which adds a layer of complexity. Furthermore, we also had to refactor parts of the code in order to make our system accommodate different entity types.

### Effort Required
1. **UI Design for CLI and GUI Integration:** This integration was challenging as it required the UI to respond dynamically to command inputs, display error messages, and present updated detailed views for both persons and events.

2. **Multi-Entity Management:** Expanding from a single-entity system to a dual-entity system required restructuring the codebase to accommodate flexible handling and interactions between entities.

3. **Documentation:** Comprehensive user guide and developer guide for all commands, data handling procedures, and error cases to assist users and developers.

### Achievements of the Project
1. **Comprehensive Family Contact and Event Manager:** LegacyLink provides users with an all-in-one solution to manage both family contacts and family events. Its unique CLI + GUI interface allows users to manage contacts and events efficiently with keyboard-based commands while benefiting from a visual interface for clarity.

2. **Clear and User-Friendly Documentation:** LegacyLinkâ€™s comprehensive guide covers every feature, command, and tips, supporting users of all technical levels.


### Reuse and Effort Savings
1. **Data Storage**: We used the same storage component to handle storing of Person and Event into a JSON file.


## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Support for events to have identical fields**: Allow events A and B to have identical fields with A's attendees being a subset of B's attendees or vice-versa, this will allow more flexibility regarding events the user wishes to add.
<br/>
<br/>
2. **Modify commands to have consistent formatting**: Currently commands like cancel and delete have inconsistent formatting, as they require an index parameter but do not have the index flag. We can perhaps force all commands to have the index flag to ensure more consistent formatting and less confusion for users.
<br/>
<br/>
3. **Generate more helpful error messages**: In some instances the error messages are not informative enough, examples include:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   a) The `update` command for attendees when used with an invalid index just returns a message saying "Attendee index is invalid" instead of showing exactly which index is invalid.<br/>It also shows the error message "This event already exists in the event book" instead of a more helpful message such as "No changes were made".

   b) The `edit` command when used with negative indices, 0 or integer overflow shows 'invalid command' instead of 'invalid index'.
   <br/>
   <br/>
   We plan to improve this by providing more information to the user on where they went wrong (e.g by showing the exact index that is invalid).
<br/>
<br/>
4.  **Support for Special Characters in Contact Names**: The current address book functionality does not support certain special characters, such as "d/o" (daughter of). We plan to enhance the address book to allow the use of special characters in person names to better accommodate a wider range of user inputs. This will ensure that users from diverse cultural backgrounds, can accurately input and save their names without encountering errors.
<br/>
<br/>
5. **Support for recurring events**: The current event book is not able to account for recurring events (e.g: Weekly tuition). We plan to enhance the event book to accommodate for recurring events, ensuring that users who wish to use the app as a daily/weekly schedule can do so with ease.
<br/>
<br/>
6. **Error Handling for Invalid Contact Names in Search**: Currently, when a user attempts to find a contact using an invalid name (e.g., one containing special characters), the search is executed without displaying an error message. This can lead to confusion as no feedback is provided regarding the invalid input. We plan to improve this behavior by implementing a validation check for invalid contact names during the search operation. If a user attempts to search with an invalid name (such as "find -/Bob"), an error message will be displayed to inform the user that the name contains invalid characters and the list will not be filtered.
<br/>
<br/>
7. **Sort the Attendee list in Event view**: Currently, an event in the event detail view does not show its attendees in alphabetically sorted order, this can lead to confusion for users as they find it harder to navigate the list of attendees to find whether some target person to attending the event or not. We plan to improve this by sorting the list of attendees in alphabetically increasing order under the Event detail view.
<br/>
<br/>
8. **Support for deleting multiple indices at a time**: Currently, users may only delete one index at a time, which can be too inefficient if the user wishes to delete a large number of indices. We plan to improve this by implementing an extended version of delete in the following way:
   <br/>
   <br/>
   a. Single index deleting - delete 1
  
   b. Multiple index deleting - delete 1 2

   c. Range index deleting - delete 1-10
  
   d. Combination deleting - delete 1 2 3-10
<br/>
<br/>
9. **Support for event start and end time in addition to just the date**: Currently Events only store the start date and end date using day, month and year. This can pose a problem for users who wish to also know what time in that date the events starts/ends. We plan to improve this by extending Events to also optionally store a start time and an end time.
<br/>
<br/>
10. **Support for non-digit characters in phone numbers**: Currently, users are not able to store non-digit characters in phone numbers which can pose a problem as sometimes people may use the '+' character to denote a country code, or even '-' characters in the phone number. Users may also want to add additional information after the phone number, e.g: 1234-5678 999 (HP) where the '(Home Number)' indicates that the phone number is a home number and not a personal handphone number. We plan to improve this by allowing users to include non-digit characters in a person's phone number field.
