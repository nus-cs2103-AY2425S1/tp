### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_supplier su/Hayley`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

---

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [Ui.java](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `SupplierListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [MainWindow](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [MainWindow.fxml](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Supplier` object residing in the `Model`.

---

### Logic component

**API** : [Logic.java](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete_supplier su/Hayley")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_supplier su/Hayley` Command" />

> **NOTE:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a supplier).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

---

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Supplier` and `Product` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueSupplierList` and `UniqueProductList`object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Supplier` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Supplier>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* Similarly, stores the 'selected' `Product` objects as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Product>`.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

> **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Supplier` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Supplier` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

---

### Storage component

**API** : [Storage.java](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

#### Assign product to supplier feature

The AssignProductCommand is responsible for assigning a specified product to a specified supplier in the inventory management application. This command involves several steps, primarily focused on validating input, checking assignment status, and updating the Model to reflect the new association between the product and supplier.

The AssignProductCommand follows these main steps when executed:
1. Find Product and Supplier
2. Check Assignment Status
3. Update Product and Supplier

<puml src="diagrams/AssignSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" />

#### Proposed Implementation

TThe AssignProductCommand is responsible for assigning a specified Product to a specified Supplier in an address book model. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how it functions:

#### Command Initialization:
AssignProductCommand is instantiated with a ProductName (product to be assigned) and Name (supplier to whom the product will be assigned).

This command object holds these details for execution.
Execution (execute method): **When the command executes, it:**

1. Finds the Product: Calls findProductByName on the Model to retrieve the Product based on productName. If not found, it throws a CommandException with a message indicating the product was not found. 
2. Finds the Supplier: Calls findSupplierByName to retrieve the Supplier based on supplierName. If the supplier is not found, it throws a CommandException.
3. Checks Assignment Status: Verifies if the product is already assigned to any supplier. If assigned to a different supplier, it throws an exception. If already assigned to the target supplier, it prevents redundant assignments.
4. Assigns the Product to the Supplier: Calls assignProductToSupplier, which creates a new Product with updated supplier information and adds it to the supplierâ€™s product list.

#### Updating the Model:

**After successful assignment:**

The model updates the supplier and product lists to reflect the new state.
It returns a success message, indicating the product and supplier names.

#### Helper Methods:
1. findProductByName: Looks up the product in the model by its name.
2. findSupplierByName: Looks up the supplier in the model by its name.
checkProductAssignmentStatus: Ensures that the product can be assigned to the supplier by checking if itâ€™s already assigned.
3. assignProductToSupplier: Updates the productâ€™s supplier reference and the supplierâ€™s product list, then updates the model with these changes.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Assign executes:**

* **Current choice:** Saves in the system after successful execution.
  * Pros: Easy to implement. Real time updates can be seen.
  * Cons: Allows a product to be supplied by only one Supplier.

---
## Planned Enhancements

1. Emails and phone numbers should be taken into account for duplicate handling, for the Add Supplier command as it currently takes only name into consideration.
2. Update can take in +/- stock level so user does not need to count current stock level just need to know the increase or decrease in stock level
3. Make the command names shorter for increasing easiness to the fast typing users.
4. We would want to implement edit features as for any information currently, the user to delete the existing one and adding new information in case of update of values. (especially in case of tags)
5. Number greater than Integer maximum will not give correct error, hence it is to be updated.
6. Supplier and Product should have different panels in UI to make it look better and for the ease of not having to switch panels with view commands unnecessarily.
7. Mac users might face some issues downloading jar file with the given instructions in UG, so the workaround shall be provided.
