## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initialises the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="650" height="1000"/>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Seed feature

#### Implementation

The seed feature seeds dummy data into SocialBook. In the event that the user clears all the contacts in SocialBook, the user can execute the seed command to seed sample data into the SocialBook and continue trying out its features.

The seed command works just like any other `Command` object and how a `Command` object communicates with the `Model` is explained in the [Logic component](#logic-component).

The seed command adds a `Person` object, in `SampleDataUtil` to the `Model`, if the `Person` object is not already inside SocialBook.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the seed command:

<puml src="diagrams/SeedActivityDiagram.puml" alt="SeedActivityDiagram" />

### View feature

#### Implementation

The view feature toggles the card status of a contact in SocialBook to either show all of their information or an abridged version of it.

The view command works just like any other `Command` object and how a `Command` object communicates with the `Model` is explained in the [Logic component](#logic-component).

The activity diagram below shows how a view command toggles the card status of a contact:

<puml src="diagrams/ViewActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ViewActivityDiagram" />


### \[Proposed\] Visit History

The visit history feature allows users to save a record of visits to contacts with optional remarks. This allows social workers to better keep track of their interactions with beneficiaries. 

The Model component would be altered such that each person would now store a visit history object:

<puml src="diagrams/VisitHistory.puml" />

It is optional to include a remark when adding a visit to the visit history. Given this implementation the person's date of last visit can be obtained from visit history.


### \[Proposed\] Emergency Contact Expansion

The emergency contact was designed to only be a phone number in the current implementation. It is intended to extend this so that the emergency contact includes a name and phone number.

A current contact can be assigned as another person's emergency contact. It is also possible to create a person who is only an emergency contact. To generalize we create a class called contactable person which has all the necessary methods and values for an emergency contact:

<puml src="diagrams/EmergencyContact.puml" />

A person will then store a ContactablePerson as their emergency contact.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* social worker in Singapore
* need to manage around 100 beneficiaries
* job scope is to befriend beneficiaries and provide emotional support and assistance where required
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: the address book acts as an easy way to locate/contact families and keep track of how long it has been since their last visit.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

For reference, our group has 5 members.

1. Make `list` command with miscellaneous parameters error message more helpful. Currently, typing `list` with miscellaneous parameters, ex. `list 123`, will result in a message that states "Please ensure your command is valid!". To improve specificity this will be changed to ask user to remove miscellaneous parameters.
2. Prevent tags from allowing underscores. When searching for tags with underscores in the find command, the underscores are interpreted as an `or`. This means that searching for the tag "low_income" will bring up all tags containing "low" and "income" instead of just "low_income".
3. Remove `remark` command while keeping remark fields. Currently, remarks can be added via the edit command or the remark command but not the add command. Instead of having a dedicated `remark` command, we will allow users to use the `add` command to create a contact with remarks, or the `edit` command to modify the remark of a contact. This change solves an associated issue whereby the remark command currently collapses the detailed view on the contact.
4. Restrict the validation regex for emails to require at least 2 domain labels in the `domainName` region of the email. Traditionally, emails require at least 2 domain labels separated by a `.`, but the current implementation only requires one domain label. Something like `johnsmith@yahoo` is accepted as an email address when it should be rejected.
5. Update the error message displayed to the user by the `edit` command upon attempt to index with 0. The current error message for `edit 0 n/Bob` states "invalid command format" when it should mention that the index provided is invalid.
6. Update the error message displayed to the user by the `remark` command upon attempt to index with 0. The current error message for `remark 0 r/Hates frisbees` states "invalid command format" when it should mention that the index provided is invalid.
7. Update the error message displayed to the user by the `delete` command upon attempt to index with 0. The current error message for `delete 0` states "invalid command format" when it should mention that the index provided is invalid.
8. Update the error message displayed to the user by the `view` command upon attempt to index with 0. The current error message for `view 0` states "invalid command format" when it should mention that the index provided is invalid.
9. Improve clarity of phone number parsing message to give users clearer direction on the issue with the entered phone number (ex. to remove accidental extra spaces).
10. Improve clarity of emergency contact error message for invalid input. Currently, entering an invalid emergency contact will give an error message about phone numbers. This can be confusing when editing a phone number and emergency contact simultaneously. The message will be edited to more explicitly mention emergency contact and the specific issue.
