### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in `Ui.java`

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the `MainWindow` is specified in `MainWindow.fxml`

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : `Logic.java`

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : `Model.java`

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : `Storage.java`

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Effort**

- Commands are made more flexible in general, requiring less strict command syntaxes as compared to AB3. This enhanced the ease of using the app.
- There were significant challenges in adjusting validation for the various commands. What inputs to allow and reject was constantly being discussed with an end result of prioritising user freedom while ensuring inputs remain relatively reasonable.
- There were difficulties agreeing on the UI which went through multiple iterations of tweaking before resulting in the current NUS-themed color palette and which is in line with the app's intended usage.
- Fields in the application were tweaked to suit NUS students' needs (eg. refactoring variables, different input validation)
- New functions added such as attendance taking function, comment
- Implementing the attendance feature required significant modifications to the existing architecture, including updates to the `Model`, `Storage`, and `Logic` components.
- Ensuring data integrity and proper synchronization between student data and attendance records was a challenge.
- Comprehensive testing was conducted to handle various edge cases, such as duplicate events, invalid inputs, and concurrent modifications.
- Documentation was updated extensively to reflect the new features, including user and developer guides.
- New function added such as attendance taking function.
- New function added such as comment.
- New function added such as multiple groups.
- New function added such as find by groups.
- New function which allows to add student by certain optional and required fields related to NUS and students.
- New default function to show offline help list when a command is wrongly typed.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team size: 4**


1. **Enhanced Find Command with Partial Matching and Group Filtering**

    Currently, the `find` command supports exact matches for names and student IDs, which may limit its usability when TAs want to locate students based on partial names. Additionally, `find` does not work well when used after `show`, as it displays students from all groups, rather than only those from the filtered group list. To improve functionality, we plan to enhance the `find` command to support both partial matching and group filtering.

     **Enhancement Goals:**

      - **Partial Matching:** Allow the `find` command to match partial names, enabling TAs to locate students even if they remember only part of a student's name.
      - **Group Filtering:** Enable `find` to respect any active `show` filter, so it only searches within the displayed subset of students. This ensures that if a TA has filtered by group using `show`, the `find` command will only search within that group rather than across all students.

2. **Enhance Grouping Functionality for Attendance Tracking**

    Currently, the `listattn` command lists all students for a given attendance event without segmentation by groups, which may cause confusion when managing multiple classes or sections. We plan to enhance the `listattn` command to allow filtering by groups, so TAs can view attendance specifically for each group within an event.

    **Implementation Considerations:**

    - Integrate the existing `group` field with the `listattn` command to support group-based filtering.
    - Update the UI to display group-specific attendance more clearly.
    - Ensure compatibility with other group and attendance features.

3. **Rename `createattn` Command to `createevent` for Consistency**

    Currently, the command for creating attendance events (`createattn`) is inconsistent with the naming of other event-related commands such as `deleteevent` and `listevents`. To improve usability and consistency, we plan to rename the `createattn` command to `createevent`.

4. **Warning for when edited fields are the same as previous fields**

    Currently, when users use the `edit` feature to update a field that is exactly the same as before (eg. editing name from `Mary Tan` to `Mary Tan`), 
  there is no warning shown. A message could be shown to warn the user in case this action was not intended.

5. **Comments will show a preview and be expandable if they are long to see the full text**

    Currently, when users use the `comment` feature there is no limit on how long comments can be. Thus, the full comment appears in the UI, which instead be expandable component to prevent overloading of information in the interface.

6. **Enhance delete to support deleting of multiple students at once**

    Currently, when users use the `delete` feature they can only delete one student at a time for example `delete 1` deletes the first student if available. In the future `delete 1 2 5` for example will be able to delete students at the index of 1, 2 and 5 on the list shown to improve efficiency.

7.  **Add specific error messages for the use of wrong prefixes in commands**
    
    Currently, a general error message appears when users enter a wrong prefix when using commands (eg. 'c/'). In future iterations, we are planning to add specific error messages for when wrong prefixes are used anywhere in the commands.

    Example Input: `add n/Mary id/A1234567H c/comment` or `edit 1 c/comment`

    Example Output: `Some prefixes entered are not supported in this command: c/`

8. **Add warnings for Year inputs that may be mistakes**

   Currently, there is no warning if a year such as '15' is inputted which is likely a user mistake since it is unlikely a student has been studying in NUS for 15 years. We plan to add in warnings for when the input to Year is >9. (Accounts for PhD students as well). The warning would apply for `add` and `edit` commands and would be appended to the end of the respective success messages on a new line. Note that the commands are allowed to execute, just with an additional warning to alert users to their possible mistake.

    Example Input: `add n/ John id/ A1234567U y/ 10` or `edit 1 y/ 11`

    Example Output: [SUCCESS_MESSAGE] + `Year specified is larger than 9. Please check that this is not a mistake` (Warning appears on a new line)
