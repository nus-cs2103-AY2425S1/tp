## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **Architecture Diagram** above presents a high-level view of the GamerBook app’s design.  

Below is a brief overview of the main components and their interactions.

**Main Components of the Architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes and connects all other components in the correct order.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The core functionality is managed by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): Manages the app’s user interface.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Processes commands.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds app data in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Handles data persistence (read/write) on the disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) section includes helper classes shared across multiple components.

**Interaction between Components**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows the interaction flow for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` which implements the corresponding API `interface`.

The class diagram below shows a partial view of these component relationships.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give detailed descriptions of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The `UI` consists of `MainWindow` and its parts like `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`. All these, including `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, capturing common traits among the visible GUI classes.

The `CommandBox` integrates with the `commandpopup` component to provide auto-suggestion functionality. It monitors changes in the `AutoSuggestionTextField` and dynamically generates `CommandTextFlows` that are displayed to the user.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* relies on the `Logic` component to execute commands and keeps a reference to the `Logic` component.
* depends on `Model` classes (e.g., `Person`) to display data in the UI.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below details the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `delete 1` command.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

#### Workflow in the Logic Component

1. **Execution Request**: `Logic` receives a command to execute.
2. **Parsing**: The command is parsed by `AddressBookParser`, which generates an appropriate command object (e.g., `DeleteCommand`).
3. **Execution**: The command object interacts with the `Model` to execute (e.g., deleting a person).
4. **Result**: A `CommandResult` object encapsulates the execution outcome, which is returned by `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

#### Parsing Flow

* **AddressBookParser**: This component identifies the appropriate command parser based on the user input (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`).
* **Command Parsers**: Each `XYZCommandParser` (e.g., `AddCommandParser`) implements the `Parser` interface, ensuring a uniform approach for handling and testing commands.
* **Command Processing**: The parser processes the user's command, generating a corresponding `Command` object (e.g., `AddCommand`). This object is then passed back to `Logic` by the `AddressBookParser`.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores data (`Person` objects) in a `UniquePersonList`.
* manages a filtered list of currently 'selected' `Person` objects, observable by the UI.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences, exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* saves and reads both address book data and user preference data in JSON format
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Implemented Undo feature

Each `Command` has its `undo()` method that undoes what the command executed.
Each command stores the necessary information to undo the execution.
All successful commands done by the user is stored in a `CommandLog`.

When `undo` is executed, the latest command in `CommandLog` is retrieved and that command's `undo()` method is called.

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagramNew-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagramNew-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` and `Command` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Instructions for Manual Testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</box>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   2. Run `java -jar gamerbook.jar` in the Terminal in the _home folder_u Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   2. Re-launch the app by running `java -jar gamerbook.jar` again.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.


### Commands Testing

1. Refer to the [User Guide](UserGuide.md) for a list of commands and their expected inputs.

2. Test each command by trying a variety of inputs, including:
    1. Valid inputs as specified in the user guide to verify correct behavior.

    2. Edge cases or unusual inputs (e.g., long strings, special characters) to assess how the application handles unexpected data.

    3. Invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect syntax or missing arguments) to confirm that the application displays helpful error messages.

3. Document any unexpected behavior or issues encountered during testing, including steps to reproduce the issue if applicable.

------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5 people  

### Preferred Time: Supporting Overnight Ranges

Currently, the **Preferred Time** feature does not support overnight ranges, such as "2300-0100". This limitation prevents users from adding or editing overnight gaming times for contacts, and using the `findtime` command with overnight ranges results in an "invalid command" error.

**Enhancement Plan**:  
We aim to modify the Preferred Time feature to accept overnight ranges, allowing users to specify late-night to early-morning availability conveniently. This change is particularly beneficial for gamers who prefer playing during nighttime hours when they have more free time.

**Current Workaround**:  
For users needing an overnight range (e.g., `2300-0100`), a workaround is to split the range into two separate intervals, such as `2300-2359` and `0000-0100`. These intervals are valid inputs and will allow the `add`, `edit`, and `findtime` commands to function as intended.

### FindTime Command: Boundary Overlap Adjustment

The `findtime` command currently considers ranges that touch at boundaries as overlapping, which leads to unintended results. For instance:

- Executing `findtime 2200-2300` currently returns all contacts whose preferred times overlap with `2200-2300`, including contacts with times `2100-2200` or `2300-2330`. This inclusion is inaccurate, as there is only a boundary overlap and not an actual time overlap.

**Enhancement Plan**:  
We plan to adjust the overlap detection mechanism in the `findtime` command so that ranges touching only at boundaries are not considered overlapping. This change will improve the accuracy of search results, ensuring that only times with actual overlap are included.

### Enhanced Error Messaging for FindTime Command

When users enter an incorrect, overnight time format in the `findtime` command, the application currently displays a generic "invalid format" message. This can be unclear for users, as it does not specify that the issue is specifically with the overnight time format.

**Enhancement Plan**:  
We plan to improve the error message for the `findtime` command to specify that the error is due to an overnight time. This will make the feedback more consistent with error messages shown in other commands.

**Benefit**:  
This adjustment will improve usability by providing more informative feedback, allowing users to quickly identify and correct the formatting issue, reducing potential frustration and increasing overall command clarity.

### Contact Card Title Overflow Handling

Currently, when a contact card contains a title or name with an excessively long string, it extends beyond the available width, which may lead to display issues and poor user experience, especially in narrow or non-optimal window sizes. This issue is unlikely to arise with typical names, but could occur with unusually long titles.

**Enhancement Plan**:  
To improve the display of contact cards, we plan to implement one of the following strategies:
- **Truncating long titles**: Set a fixed upper width limit for contact card titles. Any title exceeding this limit will be truncated and appended with "..." (ellipsis) to indicate there is more content.
- **Text wrapping**: Alternatively, we could apply CSS text wrapping to allow long titles to break into multiple lines, ensuring that the text is fully visible and does not extend beyond the card.

**Benefit**:  
This enhancement will prevent titles from overflowing and maintain a clean, consistent look for the contact cards. While the likelihood of encountering titles with such long names is low, this fix will improve usability and aesthetic appeal, especially for titles with long character names.

------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Efforts**

GamerBook Pro Max is a project built on the foundation of the original AddressBook, tailored specifically for gamers and their gaming friends. Our team of five embarked on this project to create an efficient and user-friendly application with advanced functionalities that address the unique needs of gamers.

### Difficulty Level

Adapting from the AddressBook to GamerBook Pro Max presented several challenges. While we retained core functionalities, we needed to significantly customize the app to better serve gamers. This included adding features like preferred game times, favorite games, and stateful command history, as well as implementing a powerful undo feature.

The main difficulty lay in the number of advanced features we had to develop and integrate, as each new feature introduced additional complexity. As expected, more features resulted in more potential bugs, making debugging and testing a crucial part of the development process.

### Challenges Faced

1. **Forking Workflow**:  
   Using the Forking Workflow allowed us to work on multiple features in parallel, which was vital given the size of the project. However, it also introduced the overhead of managing forks and dealing with frequent merge conflicts, especially as we worked on overlapping components such as the command history and address book state features.

2. **Feature Complexity**:  
   Many of the new features, like saving and loading address book states or command suggestions, required a careful design to ensure compatibility and stability across the system. We also had to ensure that stateful features, such as undoing commands, were correctly implemented and tested.

3. **Testing and Regression**:  
   With the introduction of so many new commands and features, the effort required to write and maintain tests grew exponentially. Writing unit tests for every new feature, along with performing comprehensive regression testing to ensure that existing functionalities were not broken, added significant effort to the development cycle.


### Effort Required

The effort required to develop GamerBook Pro Max was substantial due to the large number of features we implemented and the inevitable bugs that emerged with each new iteration. The effort to resolve issues and fine-tune the system was greater than if we had stuck to the original AddressBook functionality, but it was necessary to achieve the advanced feature set and quality of user experience we envisioned.
