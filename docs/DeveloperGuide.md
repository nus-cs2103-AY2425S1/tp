### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI. However, `DialogBox` inherits from `HBox`.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

`CommandBox` holds a reference towards `AutocompleteParser` which helps parses user input for a list of suggestions to show to the user.
### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
  
The following is an example JSON output for a person:

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone": "98765432",
    "gender": "male",
    "modules": [
        {
            "module": "CS2103T",
            "grade": 85
        }
    ],
    "tags": [
        "colleague"
    ]
}
```

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## General Flow
The activity diagram below illustrates the general flow of an interaction between the user and StoreClass.

<img src="images/GeneralFlowActivity.png" width="1000" />

1. The user enters a command in the `CommandBox`.
2. The AddressBookParser parses the command.
3. If the command is a valid command and is of a valid format, the corresponding `Command` object is created.
4. The `Command` object is executed by the `Logic` component.
5. The `UI` component displays the result of the command execution to the user. <br>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation Overview

The undo/redo functionality is implemented in the `VersionedAddressBook`, which extends the basic `AddressBook` to include versioning capabilities. This is achieved by maintaining an internal history of address book states. The history is stored in a list (`addressBookStateList`), and the current state is tracked by the `currentStatePointer`.

The key operations involved in undo/redo are:

- **`VersionedAddressBook#save()`**: Saves the current state of the address book into the history list.
- **`VersionedAddressBook#undo()`**: Restores the address book to the previous state.
- **`VersionedAddressBook#redo()`**: Restores the address book to a previously undone state.

These operations are available to the rest of the system through the `Model` interface, specifically:

- `Model#saveAddressBook()`
- `Model#undoAddressBook()`
- `Model#redoAddressBook()`

---

## How Undo/Redo Works

The mechanism functions as follows:

1. **Save**: Every modification to the address book, such as `add`, `delete`, or `edit` commands, triggers a save operation to save the current state of the address book.

2. **Undo**: The undo operation moves the `currentStatePointer` backward and restores the previous state. If no more undo operations can be performed (i.e., if the pointer is at the start of the history), the operation fails and returns an error.

3. **Redo**: The redo operation moves the `currentStatePointer` forward and restores the next state that was undone. If there are no undone states, the operation fails and returns an error.

The activity diagram below illustrates how the state list changes according to the user's commands.

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="1000" />

---

### Example Flow

Here is how undo and redo would work through a sequence of user actions:

---

#### Step 1. Initial State
Upon launching the application, the `VersionedAddressBook` is initialized with the default state (an empty address book, for example). This state is stored in the `addressBookStateList` as the first entry, and the `currentStatePointer` points to this state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

---

#### Step 2. Performing a Deletion
When a user executes the `delete` command (e.g., `delete 5`), the current state of the address book is saved before the change is made. This ensures that the delete action is reversible. The new state of the address book (with the 5th person deleted) is then stored in the history.

The `saveAddressBook()` operation is called internally, and the `currentStatePointer` is moved forward to point to the newly saved state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

---

#### Step 3. Performing an Addition
Next, if a user executes an `add` command (e.g., `add n/David ...`), a new state of the address book is created. As before, `saveAddressBook()` is invoked to save the new state, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to this new state.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#saveAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

---

#### Step 4. Undoing the Addition
If the user decides to undo the most recent action (the `add` command), the `undo` operation will restore the address book to the state before the addition. Internally, `undoAddressBook()` is called, which moves the `currentStatePointer` backward and restores the state.

If the pointer is already at the first state (the initial state), attempting to undo will return an error.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

#### Undo Sequence Diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works across the `Logic` and `Model` components:

`Logic`:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

`Model`:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

---

#### Step 5. Redoing the Addition
If the user decides to redo the action after undoing it, the `redo` operation will restore the state that was undone. The `redoAddressBook()` method is invoked, which moves the `currentStatePointer` forward to the next state in history and restores that state.

As with undo, if the pointer is at the last state in the list, trying to redo will return an error.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

#### Redo Sequence Diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the redo operation works across the `Logic` and `Model` components:

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

---

## Design Considerations

Here are the important aspects of the undo/redo implementation:

- **Saving Mechanism:** Each modification to the address book (like `add`, `delete`, or `edit`) triggers a call to `saveAddressBook()`. This function stores the current state of the address book and updates the `currentStatePointer`. However, commands that do not modify the address book (such as `list`, `find`, or `filter`) do not trigger a call to `saveAddressBook()`, and therefore do not modify the history.

- **Undo/Redo Pointer Management:** The `currentStatePointer` is moved backward during undo and forward during redo. If no more states can be undone or redone, appropriate error messages are returned.

- **Memory Considerations:** Since each address book state is stored in memory, excessive changes could increase memory usage. The current implementation keeps track of all states but might need optimization in the future, depending on the applicationâ€™s use case.

- **State Purging:** After calling `undo`, when a command that modifies the address book is executed (such as `add`, `delete`, or `edit`), the states after the current one are purged to ensure consistency. This prevents errors from conflicting history states. Additionally, after calls to `archive` and `load`, the history is also purged to ensure consistency between different data files.

### Data archiving

The archive and load feature is achieved through `ArchiveCommand` and `LoadCommand` which both extend the `Command` class. When such command is executed, the LogicManager will update the Storage when necessary.

The Following UML Object Diagrams will illustrate how archive and load are done

Before the archiving or loading

We will use a simple case where there is one working AddressBook named `addressBook.json` in `data` folder and one archived AddressBook named `archivedFile1.json` in `archived` folder

![ArchiveAndLoadInitialState](images/ArchiveAndLoadInitialState.png)

**Scenario 1 Archive to a new file**

In this scenario, the user is trying to archive the current address book into a new file named `archiveFile2.json`. He enters the command `archive pa/archiveFile2.json` A new file names `archiveFile2.json` will be created and hold the data of `addressBook.json`. And the data in `addressBook.json` will be discarded.

![ArchiveToNewFile](images/ArchiveToNewFile.png)

**Scenario 2 Archive to a existing file**

In this scenario, the user is trying to archive the current address book into the existing file named `archiveFile1.json`. He enters the command `archive pa/archiveFile1.json` A file names `archiveFile1.json` will be overwritten and hold the data of `addressBook.json`. And the data in `addressBook.json` will be discarded.

![ArchiveToNExistingFile](images/ArchiveToExistingFile.png)

The following sequence diagram illustrate how an archive operation is processed under `Logic` component.

![ArchiveSequenceDiagram](images/ArchiveSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ArchiveCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram. Some details like parameters of function is omitted for simplicity.

</div>

**Scenario 3 Loading from a file**

In this scenario, the user is trying to load the address book from a file named `archiveFile1.json`. He enters the command `load pa/archiveFile1.json`. The data in the current working address book will be discarded. The data in `archiveFile1.json` will be loaded into the working address book.
![Load](images/Load.png)

The following sequence diagram illustrate how a load operation is processed under `Logic` component.

![LoadSequenceDiagram](images/LoadSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `LoadCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram. Some details like parameters of function is omitted for simplicity.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The product should be an offline product that can run without accessing the internet, allowing access to core features such as adding, deleting, listing and archiving.
5. Sensitive student data such as contact details, grades and payment information should be protected through encryption or password protection to prevent unauthorized access.
6. The system should be able to manage an increasing number of students and additional data fields without significant performance degradation, ensuring that response times remains under 200ms.


### Glossary

* **Archive**: A feature that allows users to store old data for use later without cluttering the current interface.
* **Export**: Saving the student data in a file format as `json` file. This is done through data archiving.
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others.
* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS.
