## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**


**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_guest 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of three smaller parts:`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay` and `PersonListPanel`. All these parts, along with the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Guest`, `Vendor` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete_guest 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteGuestSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteGuestCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteGuestCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
   * Note that `EditVendorCommandParser` and `EditGuestCommandParser` parser classes require the `Model`, to check if the guest or vendor index provided by the user is valid or not.<br> 
<br>
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteGuestCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.

1. When the `Command` object is executed, it communicates with the `Model` (e.g., to delete a guest). <br>
   In the sequence diagram example above, the `Command` object first calls the `getFilteredGuestList` method, followed by the `deletePerson` method on the `Model` during its execution, illustrating one possible sequence of communication. 

1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="700" height="650" />

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddGuestCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddGuestCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
  * As explained above, some `XYZCommandParser` classes require the `Model` for parsing. 
  * Note that for `clear`, `list`, `exit`, `help` and `stats` user commands, the `AddressBookParser` directly returns the `Command` object, and no corresponding `XYZCommandParser` class is created (as there is no extra info to parse). <br>
<br> 
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddGuestCommandParser`, `DeleteGuestCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="750" height="720" />

Note: `Vendor` and `Guest` both extend from the abstract `Person` class, which defines common attributes and behaviors shared by both types of entities.

The `Model` component,
* stores the address book data i.e., all `Guest` and `Vendor` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Guest` / `Vendor` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" />

The `Storage` component,
* Can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
  * `Storage` saves `Guest` into JSON format and reads back into `Guest` object, using the `JsonAdapatedGuest` class.
  * `Storage` saves `Vendor` into JSON format and reads back into `Vendor` object, using the `JsonAdaptedVendor` class. <br>
<br>
* Inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).

* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Guest feature
The `add_guest` command creates and adds a new `Guest` object into the address book. The attributes of the `Guest` are specified through prefixes (n/, p/, e/, a/, rsvp/, r/ and t/) and their corresponding values.

The sequence diagrams below provide an overview for the execution flow of an `add_guest` command.
<br>
Note: In the diagrams below,
- Let **C** represent the command: "add_guest n/Joe p/98765432 e/joe@gmail.com a/Nexus"
- Let **args** represent the arguments provided in the command: "n/Joe p/98765432 e/joe@gmail.com a/Nexus"
- Let **m** represent an instance of the Model

<puml src="diagrams/AddGuestSequenceDiagramP1.puml" />
<puml src="diagrams/AddGuestSequenceDiagramP3.puml" />
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddGuestCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

Explanation:
1. The `execute` method of `LogicManager` is called with the user input as the argument to begin the command execution.
2. `AddressBookParser` parses the user input initially. If the user input is identified to be an `add_guest` command, it creates and returns an `AddGuestCommandParser` for further parsing. 
3. `AddGuestCommandParser` parses the arguments provided in the user input to extract the prefixes and their values, which are used to create a `Guest` object with the corresponding attributes.
   * Suppose the n/, p/, e/ and a/ prefixes and their values are provided (these are compulsory).
   * Then, a `Guest` object with name, phone number, email and address attributes will be created. <br> 
4. An `AddGuestCommand` is then created with the new `Guest` object and returned.
5. `LogicManager` executes the `AddGuestCommand`, which calls the `addPerson` method of `Model` to add the guest into the address book.
6. A `CommandResult` containing the success message is then returned to the `LogicManager` (and then back to the `UI` component).

### Edit Guest feature
The `edit_guest` command updates the details of an existing guest in the address book. Users can specify the guest to be edited by providing the index number (positive, starting from 1) of that guest. New guest details are specified through prefixes (n/, p/, e/, a/, rsvp/, r/ and t/) and their corresponding values.

The sequence diagrams below provide an overview for the execution flow of an `edit_guest` command:

Note: In the diagrams below,
- Let **m** represent an instance of the Model.

<puml src="diagrams/EditGuestSequenceDiagramP1.puml" />
<puml src="diagrams/EditGuestSequenceDiagramP3.puml" />
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `EditGuestCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

Explanation:
1. The `execute` method of `LogicManager` is called with the user input as the argument to begin the command execution.
2. `AddressBookParser` parses the user input initially. If the user input is identified to be an `edit_guest` command, it creates and returns an `EditGuestCommandParser` for further parsing.
3. `EditGuestCommandParser` parses the arguments provided by the user input to extract the prefixes and their values, which are used to create an `EditGuestDescriptor` object that captures the updated information <br>
4. An `EditGuestCommand` is then created with the guest index provided, as well as the new `EditGuestDescriptor` object.
5. `LogicManager` executes the `EditGuestCommand`, which retrieves the guest list from `Model`. The guest index is used to access the target guest to edit. An edited guest with the updated name (from the example above) is then created using the existing target guest and the `EditGuestDescriptor`. The `setPerson` method is then called to replace the existing target guest with the edited guest. Subsequently, the `updateFilteredPersonList` method from `Model` is called to update the filtered list.
6. A `CommandResult` containing the success message is then returned to the `LogicManager` (and then back to the `UI` component).

### Find feature
The `find` command searches for all guests and vendors that match any of the given keyword(s) and displays them. The prefix specified in the command indicates the attribute to be searched. Do note that exactly one type of prefix should be used for each find command.

The sequence diagrams below provide an overview for the execution flow of a `find` command:

Note: In the diagrams below,
- Let **m** represent an instance of the Model.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagramP1.puml" />
<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagramP3.puml" />
<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

Explanation:
1. The `execute` method of `LogicManager` is called with the user input as the argument to begin the command execution
2. `AddressBookParser` parses the user input initially. If the user input is identified to be a `find` command, it creates and returns a `FindCommandParser` for further parsing.
3. `FindCommandParser` parses the arguments provided in the user input to extract the prefix and its corresponding value. Then, it calls the corresponding parse predicate method to create the corresponding predicate to be used. In the above example, since the name prefix is specified, the `parseNamePredicate` method is called to create a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object.
4. A `FindCommand` is then created with the predicate and returned.
5. `LogicManager` executes the `FindCommand`, which calls the `updateFilteredPersonList` method of the `Model` with the predicate as the argument. This method filters the list of guests and vendors based on the predicate. In this example, guests and vendors whose name matches the given keyword `John` will be kept in the filtered list. Subsequently, the `FindCommand` calls `getFilteredGuestListCount` and `getFilteredVendorListCount` methods from `Model` to respectively obtain the number of remaining guests and vendors. 
6. A `CommandResult` containing the success message is then returned to the `LogicManager` (and then back to the `UI` component).

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Data Requirements**
1. Size: The system should support storage for up to 300 guests and 300 vendors per wedding.
1. Volatility: Guest lists and vendor details may change frequently, especially closer to the event date. Therefore, the system must accommodate dynamic data updates and edits.
1. Persistency: All guest and vendor information must be saved persistently in a JSON file and remain accessible even after system shutdown or failure.

**Environment Requirements**
1. Operating System: The system must be compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems.
1. Dependencies: Java 17 should be the core language.

**Accessibility**
1. Provide help documentation that can be accessed at any time with a simple command (help).

**Fault Tolerance**
1. The system should handle errors such as missing commands or invalid input gracefully, providing clear error messages without causing system crashes.
1. Ensure that invalid input (e.g., incorrect email format) does not result in data corruption.

**Performance Requirements**
1. The system should respond to user input within ten seconds, even for lists of up to 300 guests and 300 vendors.
1. System startup time should not exceed ten seconds on standard hardware.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix B: Planned Enhancements**

In developing BridalBuddy, we've identified areas that can benefit from enhancement. We believe in transparency and keeping our users informed, so we want to acknowledge these feature limitations.

### Support for managing multiple weddings

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

Currently, BridalBuddy is designed to manage only a single wedding at a time. 
This limits its functionality for users who may be planning multiple weddings simultaneously or managing various events, 
such as wedding planners working with several clients. 
Without support for multiple weddings, users may face challenges in organizing and accessing information for each event separately.

**Proposed Enhancement**

Introduce functionality to manage multiple weddings within the application. 
This would include separate profiles or dashboards for each wedding, with individual guest and vendor lists. 
Users could easily switch between weddings, ensuring all information remains organized and accessible. 
This enhancement would broaden BridalBuddy's usability for professional planners or users involved in multiple wedding events.

### Enhance name to accept special characters

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

Currently, names do not accept `.` and `/` and other special characters that might appear in a person's legal name.

**Proposed Enhancement**

We should remove strict alphanumeric checks for names to support special characters, allowing for more accurate entries.

### Improve command parsing to handle common characters in fields

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

The current design of BridalBuddy's command parser does not accept certain characters, such as `/`, within input fields (e.g., addresses or company names).
When users include these characters as part of standard text entriesâ€”such as `a/123 Main St/Suite 5`â€”the parser interprets `St/` as an unrecognized prefix, 
resulting in unnecessary parsing errors and frustrating interruptions.

**Proposed Enhancement**

To address this design limitation, enhance the command parsing logic to allow `/` within fields without mistaking them for new prefixes. 
By improving how BridalBuddy distinguishes between field content and actual command prefixes, users will experience fewer parsing errors and a smoother, more accurate input process.

### Enhance flexibility in phone number parameter input

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

Currently, the phone number field only accepts integers as valid input.
However, planners might encounter scenarios, such as keeping track of overseas guests, where symbols like `()`, `+`, `-` and `.` are needed.
The current restriction limits users from including such details, potentially causing confusion about the origin of the number.

**Proposed Enhancement**

We can relax validation on the phone number field to allow symbols such as `()`, `+`, `-` and `.`.

### Enhance `find` command to allow for partial and substring search

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

Currently, the `find` command requires an exact match or a specific keyword for searching guests or vendors.
This limits the flexibility of the search functionality, as users cannot retrieve entries that partially match the search term.

**Proposed Enhancement**

Enhance the `find` command to allow partial and substring searches.
With this enhancement, a search query would return all results containing the specified character(s) or substring, regardless of its position in the name or other fields.

### Enhance `find` command to allow multiple types of prefixes to be used for each `find` command

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

Currently, users can only use one type of prefix for each `find` command. As such, users are unable to use multiple types of prefixes within the same `find` command. 
For example, `find n/John p/98765432` is an invalid command.

**Proposed Enhancement**

Enhance `find` command to allow multiple types of prefixes to be used for each `find` command so that users can search for multiple fields with a single `find` command.
For example, with this enhancement, `find n/John p/98765432` will return all guest(s) and vendor(s) that have the name John and the phone number 98765432

### Restrict special characters in the address field

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

Currently, the address field accepts any character, including symbols like `$`, `%` or emojis, which are generally uncommon in typical addresses.
This may result in inconsistent data entries and impact the professionalism and readability of the contact list.

**Proposed Enhancement**

Introduce validation for the address field to allow only common address characters (letters, numbers, spaces, commas, etc.) while restricting uncommon symbols and emojis.
This will maintain consistent and realistic address entries.

### Expand current `stats` command to include additional metrics

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

The existing `stats` command in BridalBuddy only provides statistics on guest attendance, such as counts of those attending, declining, or yet to respond.
While this information is helpful, the feature could be improved by providing additional insights, such as the current budgetâ€”a crucial aspect of wedding planning. 
Without budget metrics, planners may find it challenging to get a comprehensive view of the wedding's overall progress.

**Proposed Enhancement**

Enhance the `stats` command to display both attendance and budget metrics, providing a more comprehensive overview.  
By combining attendance statistics with budget metrics, the enhanced `stats` command will give planners a fuller picture of the weddingâ€™s status, making it easier to manage both attendance and finances in one place.

### Support for multiple currencies in budget tracking

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**

Currently, BridalBuddy's budget tracking feature only supports the dollar symbol (`$`), 
which may not be suitable for users in countries where other currency symbols (such as `Â£`, `â‚¬`, `Â¥`, etc.) are standard. 
This limitation can lead to confusion and reduce usability for international users who need their local currency symbol represented.

**Proposed Enhancement**

Update the budget tracking feature to allow users to input their preferred currency symbol. 
This enhancement would enable planners to use a symbol that reflects their local currency, making the budget tracking experience more intuitive and globally accessible. 
This change would improve clarity and provide a more personalized experience for users in various regions.

### Extend `clear` command to clear Guests and Vendors Separately

**Feature Flaw in Current Implementation**
The existing `clear` command in BridalBuddy deletes all Guests and Vendors. 
In some situations, users might want to clear only either the Guest or Vendor list.
This command may cause some inconvenience as users would have to manually delete all Guests or all Vendors.

**Proposed Enhancement**
Extend the clear function with two more functions `clear_guest` and `clear_vendor` to delete all Guests or all Vendors respectively.
This would help to resolve the aforementioned scenario, allowing users more functionality.

## **Appendix D: Efforts**

### Adapting AB3 for Multiple Entity Types

**Difficulty Level**: Very high

**Challenges Faced**: AB3 was designed to manage a single entity typeâ€”contacts.
Our project, however, required managing two distinct entities, guests and vendors, each with unique fields and functionalities
(e.g., RSVP status for guests, company name for vendors).

**Effort Required**: Modifying the data model to accommodate multiple entities required extensive refactoring of the underlying structure.
This included updates to storage, command parsing, and validation logic, to support both entity types consistently while maintaining functionality for existing commands.
We also spent significant time adjusting current commands to recognize and process both guests and vendors without errors.

**Achievements**: We successfully integrated both entity types while maintaining a clean architecture, enabling BridalBuddy to
manage multiple types of contacts with specific fields and functionalities, all without compromising compatibility with existing commands.

### Introducing New Optional and Custom Fields

**Difficulty Level**: Medium

**Challenges Faced**: We added new optional fields, such as budget for vendors, and relationship type for guests.
This required additional validations and command adjustments to handle partial data inputs, ensuring user flexibility.

**Effort Required**: Implementing and validating optional fields involved command parsing, updates to storage,
and ensuring proper input validation (e.g. budgets specified to two decimal places).

**Achievements**: The added flexibility in fields has made BridalBuddy adaptable to a wider variety of planning needs, while the validation ensures high data reliability.

### UI Customization

**Difficulty Level**: High

**Challenges Faced**: Customising the UI to clearly distinguish between guests and vendors required significant modifications to AB3's existing UI structure,
which proved more complex than backend coding. Editing the UI relied heavily on visual adjustments, involving considerable trial and error to achieve the right
layout and style.

**Effort Required**: We restructured the layout to visually separate guest and vendor lists, allowing users to easily differentiate and manage each contact type.

**Achievements**: The customized UI offers a more intuitive experience, allowing users to quickly access and manage information specific to guests and vendors.

### Statistics Display

**Difficulty Level**: Medium

**Challenges Faced**: Implementing the statistics command required adapting AB3â€™s structure to dynamically calculate and display counts of guests and vendors.

**Effort Required**: We developed a new `stats` command that calculates and returns the total counts of guests and vendors.

**Achievements**: The `stats` command offers users a quick overview of the total number of guests and vendors, providing planners with valuable insights at a glance.
