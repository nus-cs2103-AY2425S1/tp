## **Setting up, getting started**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="360" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic Component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="450"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="750"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model Component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="750" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Contact` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="720" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Pagination

The pagination makes use of `javafx.scene.control.Pagination` component which is inherited by `PaginationPanel`.
The `PaginationPanel.java` stores all logic and attributes related to Pagination.

The `PaginationPanel` contains the following member/class variables:

* `ROWS_PER_PAGE`: Represents the number of items to display in a single page.
* `currentPageIndex`: Represents the index (0-indexed) of the current page, it is shared among all instances and hence `static`.
* `contactList`: A **reference** of `ObservableList<Person>` from `Logic` during the initialization of UI.

#### Implementation of Constructor

The constructor of `PaginationPanel` takes in a reference of `ObservableList<Person>` and stores it as a member variable.
Since it is _observable_, the pagination listens to the event when there is an update of `contactList`, this is implemented by
`this.contactList.addListener(this::onListItemsChanged)`. Then the constructor initializes the pagination component.


#### Steps to Update the List when there is a Change

Since the constructor adds a listener that listens to `onListItemsChanged` event on `contactList`.
The `onListItemsChanged` simply invokes `initPagination` to re-render the list displayed.
It takes the following steps to make the update:

1. Calculate the number of pages by `contactList.size()` and `ROWS_PER_PAGE`. The `Math::max` ensures that there is **at least one** page
even when there is no item. Then it updates the page count of the pagination.
2. Calculate the starting index of sublist from `contactList`.
3. Calculate the end index of sublist from `contactList`. The `Math::min` makes sure that the index does not go beyond the list size. Hence,
when there is less than the default `ROWS_PER_PAGE` number of items to render, it can correctly render all remaining items without the risk of
triggering `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException`.
4. Get the sublist to be rendered based on the calculated `fromIndex` and `endIndex`.
5. Render the updated sublist.

### Status Bar Footer: how to reflect the total number of contacts 
The `ModelManager` class also stores `allContacts` attribute, on top of the `filteredList` attribute present initially. It represents the full list of contacts which the model can keep track on. 
A listener is added to allow StatusBarFooter to indirectly listen for any changes made to the `allContacts`. If changes are detected, the StatusBarFooter can update the total number of contacts accordingly.

### Non-Functional Requirements

   - The application should function on any mainstream operating system (Windows, macOS, and Linux) that supports Java 17 or above.

   - The application should handle up to 1,000 members without noticeable performance lag for standard operations such as adding, editing, and searching contacts.

   - A user with an above-average typing speed for English text should be able to execute commands and accomplish tasks more quickly than by relying solely using commands than using a mouse. 

   - The application should operate fully offline, with no reliance on an internet connection for core functionalities, including saving and retrieving contact information.

   - Comprehensive documentation should be available, including a User Guide, command references, and troubleshooting instructions, to support users and developers alike.

   - The GUI should be well-organised, user-friendly, and easy to navigate for users of all experience levels, with intuitive layouts and accessible help options.

   - The application should handle common user errors effectively, displaying clear error messages and suggestions to help users correct their input where possible.

   - The application should support English as the default language, with future releases allowing for additional languages if necessary.

   - The application should support future integration with external contact management systems, allowing for seamless data transfer if needed.

   - The application should periodically create a backup of contact data, enabling users to restore from the most recent backup in the event of data loss or corruption.

   - The application should be able to retrieve and display member data within 2 seconds.

   - The application should  validate data entries to ensure consistency and correctness (eg. check that email format is correct etc.)

This appendix provides a comprehensive approach to testing the data_coNdUctorS app, ensuring each core feature and edge case is addressed. Error messages will appear on the screen if incorrect inputs are entered, helping users to correct their input efficiently.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

This section outlines the planned future enhancements for the data_coNdUctorS application to improve functionality, usability, and scalability.

---

### Advanced Error Messages

Informing the User what is their specific issue with the command that they have inputted.

* Goal: Quality of Life for users to understand which part of the command they inputted wrongly so they don't have to waste time.
  
* Example 1: Editing a contact with the same `NAME` and `NICKNAME` as an existing contact will result in an error message: "This Contact already exists in the address book". This is not very clear so in the future, we could display the said contact to the user and inform them which fields are duplicated.
   
* Example 2: Executing this command `add n/John Doe th/johnny_9876_haha e/johnd@example.com ss/undergraduate 3 r/Admin r/President [nn/altName]` will output an error message saying invalid Role. Instead, should tell the user that the Role they implemented is `President [` which is not recognised as a role.
      
* Expected Outcome: Users will waste less time debugging their inputs, especially for large address books.

---

### Case Insensitivity for All Contact Fields

Some Contact fields are case-sensitive so errors arise during duplicate contacts being loaded into the address book

* Goal: Reduce accidental duplicates to enhance the user experience when interacting with the contact list.

* Case 1: `Nickname` is case-sensitive (e.g., `nn/alice` and `nn/Alice` are considered distinct). After this enhancement, `nn/alice` and `nn/Alice` will be treated as identical, reducing potential conflicts caused by casing differences. Contacts will be flagged as having the same identity if both `Name` and `Nickname` match in a case-insensitive manner.

* Case 2: `Telegram Handle` and `Email` are also case-sensitive. In the enhanced version, these fields will also become case-insensitive, ensuring no two contacts can have the same `Telegram Handle`, `Email`, or `Nickname`, even if they differ only by letter casing.

* Expected Outcome: Reduce errors and confusion due to case variations. Ensure that no two contacts have the same `Telegram Handle`, `Email`, or `Nickname` regardless of case, thereby improving data integrity.

---

### Display Index of Newly Added Contact

Users may be uncertain about where a newly added contact appears within the contact list.

* Goal: Clearly indicate the index of the newly added contact so that users can easily locate and verify the contact’s information without unnecessary searching.

* Example: When a contact is added, the UI will default to displaying the first page. However, since contacts are listed in alphabetical order, the new contact may not be visible on this page if it appears further down the list. Users may end up scrolling through multiple pages to locate the newly added contact, especially if they are unfamiliar with other contacts in the system.

* Expected Outcome: Users can instantly see the index of the added contact, allowing them to navigate directly to its location without spending extra time searching through the list.

## Appendix: Effort

### Difficulty Level
If the Individual Project (IP) was rated a difficulty of 5/10, this `Data_coNdUctorS` Team Project (TP) would be a solid 9/10. While we didn't implement highly advanced features, the project posed significant challenges, especially for our team of mostly non-Computer Science majors. Transitioning from the IP to the TP required adapting to complex structures, such as multiple `CommandParsers`, working with `.fxml` files for UI design, and fully utilising GitHub's collaborative tools. These elements presented a steep learning curve and demanded a lot of adjustment.

---

### Challenges Faced

- Pagination: As we modified the AddressBook3 (AB3) UI, we aimed to introduce pagination to help users navigate large contact lists efficiently. Although we found some resources and code snippets online, implementing comprehensive test cases for the pagination feature proved challenging. This lowered our overall CodeCov score, as we struggled to find suitable ways to test this UI-centric functionality.

- Test Coverage: Maintaining high test coverage was a significant challenge, especially due to the new UI features and pagination, which reduced our overall CodeCov score. As we were still learning to work with automated testing, achieving comprehensive test coverage for these features required more experience than we initially had.

- JavaFX Framework: JavaFX was entirely new to the team, and we found it challenging to implement the necessary UI enhancements. We devoted considerable time to learning JavaFX basics, which delayed some of our intended progress but ultimately provided us with valuable skills.

- IntelliJ Integration: For most of us, IntelliJ was a new development environment, and we initially struggled to navigate its features. Many of us used CLI commands in the terminal until around week 11, when we discovered that IntelliJ could streamline many processes, including Git commands. This realisation greatly improved our workflow and efficiency for the remainder of the project.

---

### Effort Required
The project required consistent, focused effort from each team member. 

Each week, we met as a team 2 to 3 times. The first meeting was usually to distribute tasks, with a check-in meeting closer to the submission deadline and a final meeting on the due date to ensure everything was ready for submission. These meetings accounted for approximately 4-6 hours per week. Additionally, each team member spent an average of 7 hours per week working independently on the project. Tse Hui went above and beyond, dedicating 12-14 hours weekly to drive our progress forward.

---

### Achievements
Despite the challenges, we achieved several milestones that we're proud of:

- Realistic Goal Setting and Achievement: Although we didn't add an extensive list of features, we set realistic project goals and are proud to have met them. This includes valuable learning outcomes, such as mastering GitHub for version control, exploring IntelliJ’s integrated tools, and learning how to collaborate effectively on a software project as a team.
- Skill Development: Our work on this project allowed each team member to grow technically and collaboratively, strengthening our foundational skills in Java, JavaFX, and project management practices.
