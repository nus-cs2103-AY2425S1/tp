### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The UI for the Single page person view is a standalone UI window that is called through the functionalities of the
application itself.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€” Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€” Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€” Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into
the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite â€” it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <strong>Note:</strong> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_


### View Window
The view window function in the application allows for the user
to  view the full contents of a contact through a pop-up GUI.

Given it is a pop-up there is a different mechanism that calls and closes
the view window.

Given below is a sequence diagram to highlight the differences in implementation

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)


### Log Command
Log command add a log entry to person at given index.
Given below is a sequence diagram of favourite command usage.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: 
The log command is a command that updates the person model. Similar commands within RealConnect follow the same
sequence diagram.
</div>


### Favourite Command
Favourite command given different parameter can favourite/unfavourite a person in the list at the given index, or sort the list by Favourite.
Given below is a sequence diagram of favourite command usage.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**

* Real estate agents
* Need manage a large number of clients with varying details
* Need to record past engagement with clients
* Can type fast
* Prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:
This app helps real estate agents efficiently manage client relationships by centralizing contact details and logging
interactions. Also, automated reminders and notes ensure that you never miss an opportunity to engage clients. It
simplifies client management but focuses only on handling moderate-sized contact lists, without support for financial
transactions, property details, or large-scale CRM functions.

### Use cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `AddressBook` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified
otherwise)

### Use Case: **UC01 - Delete a Contact**

**Actor**: Salesperson  
**Precondition**: The contact exists in the contact list.  
**Guarantees**: The specified contact is removed from the AddressBook, and the Salesperson receives confirmation of the deletion.

#### Main Success Scenario (MSS):
1. The Salesperson requests to list persons.
2. AddressBook displays a list of persons.
3. The Salesperson issues the `delete` command with a valid contact index.
4. AddressBook validates the contact index.
5. AddressBook removes the specified contact from the contact list.
6. AddressBook displays a success message: "Contact `NAME` deleted."

   **Use case ends.**

---

#### Extensions:
- **2a.** The list is empty.
  - **Use case ends.**

- **3a.** The command format is incorrect (e.g., contact index not provided).
  - **3a1.** AddressBook displays an error message:
    
    `Invalid command format!`
    
    `delete: Deletes the person identified by the index number used in the displayed person list.`
    
    `Parameters: INDEX (must be a positive integer)`
    
    `Example: delete 1`
    
  - **Use case resumes at Step 2.**

- **4a.** The contact index is invalid or out of bounds.
  - **4a1.** AddressBook displays an error message: `The person index provided is invalid.`
  - **4a2.** The Salesperson corrects the contact index and reissues the command.
  - **Use case resumes from Step 3.**

---

#### Including Related Use Cases:
- **UC06 - View Full Contact Details**: The Salesperson may use this use case to view the contactâ€™s full details before confirming the deletion.
- **UC09 - Display Help Information**: The `help` command will include a link that includes instructions on how to use the `delete` command.

---

### Use Case: **UC02 - Sort Contact List Alphabetically**
**Actor**: Salesperson  
**Precondition**: The system has a non-empty list of contacts.  
**Guarantees**: The contact list is sorted in the specified order (ascending or descending), and the Salesperson can view the sorted list.

#### Main Success Scenario (MSS):
1. The Salesperson issues the `sort` command with a specified order (ascending or descending).
2. The system validates the sorting parameter (`asc` or `desc`).
3. The system sorts the contact list based on the specified order.

### Use Case: **UC15 - Add Property for a Contact**

**Actor**: User  
**Precondition**: The AddressBook application is running, and the User has a contact they wish to associate with a property listing.  
**Guarantees**: The specified property listing is added to the chosen contact in the AddressBook.

#### Main Success Scenario (MSS):
1. The User issues the `addProperty` command, specifying a valid index and complete property details, including address, town, type, size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and price.
2. AddressBook validates each parameter for correctness:
- **Address** is checked to confirm it is non-empty and follows an acceptable alphanumeric and punctuation format.
- **Town** is validated as a non-empty, alphabetic string.
- **Property Type** is validated to ensure it is a valid type (e.g., "Condo", "HDB", "Landed").
- **Size** is validated as a positive number representing square meters.
- **Number of Bedrooms** is validated as a non-negative integer.
- **Number of Bathrooms** is validated as a non-negative integer.
- **Price** is validated as a positive number representing the asking price in the relevant currency.
3. AddressBook adds the validated property details to the contact at the specified index.
4. AddressBook displays a success message and updates the contact's details with the new property listing.

   **Use case ends.**

---

#### Extensions:
- **1a.** The command format is invalid.
  - **1a1.** AddressBook displays an error message: `Invalid command format! COMMAND_FORMAT.`
  - **Use case ends.**

- **2a.** The provided index is out of range or does not correspond to any contact.
  - **2a1.** AddressBook displays an error message: `The person index provided is invalid.`
  - **Use case ends.**

- **2b.** One or more property details are invalid:
  - **2b1.** AddressBook displays specific error messages based on the missing or invalid parameter:
    - **Invalid Bedrooms**: `Invalid integer value: INVALID_INPUT`
    - **Invalid Bathrooms**: `Invalid integer value: INVALID_INPUT`
    - **Invalid Price**: `Invalid double value: INVALID_INPUT`
  - **Use case ends.**

- **2c.** One or more property details are missing:
  - **2c1.** AddressBook displays an error message: `Invalid command format! COMMAND_FORMAT.`
  - **Use case ends.**

---

#### Postconditions:
- The contactâ€™s property list is updated to include the new property listing if all inputs are valid. If any errors occur, the property is not added.

---

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Portability:**
- The app should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.

2. **Efficiency**
- A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be
  able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

3. **Usability:**
- The app should provide clear error messages for incorrect inputs (e.g., invalid phone numbers, dates) and guide the user in correcting them.

4. **Reliability:**
- The app must have an uptime of at least 99.5% during business hours.
- Data, such as contacts and interaction logs, should be autosaved after each modification, ensuring no loss of data during usage.

5. **Scalability:**
- While optimized for a moderate number of contacts (up to 1000), the app should still function with reduced performance for up to 2,000 contacts.

6. **Maintainability:**
- The codebase should follow standard code style and be modular, ensuring ease of updates and bug fixes.
- The app should allow easy export and import of contact data for backup or migration purposes.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS

* **Real Estate Agent**: A professional who manages the buying, selling, and renting of properties, and maintains relationships with clients.

* **Contact List**: A digital repository where client details such as name, phone number, address, and email are stored.

* **Interaction Log**: A chronological record of communication or meetings with a client, typically used to track past engagements.

* **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A user interface where commands are typed, offering a faster alternative to graphical interface interactions.

* **Favourite**: A contact marked as important for easy access.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Planned Enhancements**

### Editing and deleting log entries
* Currently RealConnect does not support editing or deleting history logs. This feature is designed as such due to the nature of logging, of which modification or postmortem addition is not encouraged. However to tolerate user mistakes such as accidental wrong input, editing and deleting of log will be implemented and added to RealConnect.

### Editing and deleting of properties
* Currently, users can only add properties to contacts, but they cannot edit existing properties or delete any contact's properties. As RealConnect is primarily a tool for real estate agents, this limitation is recognized as a feature gap, as properties often need updates or corrections due to market changes or evolving client requirements. To address this, RealConnect will implement property editing and deletion functions, allowing agents to maintain more accurate and current property records. These updates aim to improve flexibility and support efficient management of listings in an agent's portfolio.

### More flexible date input formatting
* Currently, RealConnect only supports the date format `yyyy-mm-dd`, which may be restrictive for some users. To improve usability, the platform will expand its accepted date formats to include more common variations, such as `dd-mm-yyyy`, `dd Month yyyy` (e.g., `22 May 2001`), and potentially region-specific formats. This enhancement will provide users with greater flexibility and make the platform more accessible to diverse user groups, reducing the chance of input errors due to date formatting.

### Confirmation upon unusual input when adding properties
* Currently RealConnect accepts any non-negative integer values for property attributes number of bathrooms and bedrooms. Additional confirmation dialog will be implemented in the future to prompt the user to confirm unusually large input like 2000 bathrooms, to mitigate the chance of user mistakes.

### Allow closing App by clicking close button
* RealConnect as a CLI App currently support closing the application by command `exit`, force closing by clicking the close button of the window while person detail window is up may cause the detail card window to not close properly. In the future our team will focus on the GUI interaction more to resolve this issue.
