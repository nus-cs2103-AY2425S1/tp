### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Appointment` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects and `Appointment` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` and a `UniqueAppointmentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Patient and Add Doctor Features
This feature allows users to add new patients and doctors to MediContacts.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add-patient` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. MediContacts will be loaded in with the information stored in the `addressbook.json` file.

Step 2. The user executes `add-patient` command, with all the required parameters and with valid inputs. The `add-patient` command will indirectly call `Model#addPerson()` to add the new patient to the address book.


See below sequence diagram for the `add-patient` command:
![AddPatientSequenceDiagram](images/AddPatientSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence of operations for `add-doctor` is similar to `add-patient`, with the only difference being that the `add-doctor` command will indirectly call `Model#addDoctor()` to add the new doctor to the address book.

### Delete Patient and Delete Doctor Features
This feature allows users to delete patients and doctors from MediContacts.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `delete` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. MediContacts will be loaded in with the information stored in the `addressbook.json` file.

Step 2. The user executes `delete` command, with the index of the patient/doctor to be deleted. The `delete` command will indirectly call `Model#deletePerson()` to delete the patient/doctor from the address book.

See below sequence diagram for the `delete` command:
![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

### List Patients and List Doctors Features
This feature allows users to list all patients and doctors stored in MediContacts.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `list-patient` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. MediContacts will be loaded in with the information stored in the `addressbook.json` file.

Step 2. The user executes `list-patient` command. The `list-patient` command will indirectly call `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to get the list of patients/doctors to be displayed.

See below sequence diagram for the `list` command:
![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence of operations for `list-doctor` is similar to `list-patient`, with the only difference being that the `list-doctor` command will indirectly call `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to get the list of doctors to be displayed.

### Find Patient and Find Doctor Features
This feature allows users to find a specific patient or doctor stored in MediContacts.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `find-patient` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. MediContacts will be loaded in with the information stored in the `addressbook.json` file.

Step 2. The user executes `find-patient` command, with the name of the patient to be found. The `find-patient` command will indirectly call `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to get the list of patients/doctors to be displayed.

Sequence Diagram is similar to the above list command, therefore not repeated here.

The sequence of operations for `find-doctor` is similar to `find-patient`, with the only difference being that the `find-doctor` command will indirectly call `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` to get the list of doctors to be displayed.

### Add Appointment Feature
This feature allows users to add appointments for patients and doctors in MediContacts.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add-appt` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. MediContacts will be loaded in with the information stored in the `addressbook.json` file.

Step 2. The user executes `add-appt` command, with all the required parameters and with valid inputs. The `add-appt` command will indirectly call `Model#addAppointment()` to add the new appointment to the address book.

See below sequence diagram for the `add-appt` command:
![AddApptSequenceDiagram](images/AddApptSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete Appointment Feature
This feature allows users to delete appointments from MediContacts.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `delete-appt` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. MediContacts will be loaded in with the information stored in the `addressbook.json` file.

Step 2. The user executes `delete-appt` command, with the index of the appointment to be deleted. The `delete-appt` command will indirectly call `Model#deleteAppointment()` to delete the appointment from the address book.

See below sequence diagram for the `delete-appt` command:

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. The system should be designed to allow the addition of new features, such as supporting other user types (e.g., nurses, staff) or integrating external systems, with minimal changes to the core codebase.
3. The system must securely store patient and doctor information to comply with healthcare data privacy regulations, such as HIPAA.
4. The system should log all user actions, such as adding, deleting, or modifying records. Logs should be stored for a minimum of 6 months and be accessible to authorized administrators for auditing purposes.
5. The system should provide a response time of less than 2 seconds for any user interaction under normal load (i.e., up to 1000 patients and 500 doctors).

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Healthcare Data Privacy Regulations**: Laws and standards that govern the storage and access to patient and doctor data. Examples include HIPAA.
* **HIPAA**: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, a regulation in the U.S. that mandates secure handling of personal health information.
* **Audit**: A record of all changes made in the system, including who made the changes and when.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Team Size: 5
1. **Update `add-patient` and `add-doctor` commands to check the date of birth and phone number input for logical inputs**
   1. Currently, both commands do not check whether the given data is a valid date of birth.
   2. We plan to make the commands check whether the data of birth given is not just in the correct format given, but also to check that it is:
      1. In the past (dates that are in the future from current date are illogical)
      2. Not too far in the past (e.g. 200 years ago from current date are illogical)
   3. We also plan to make the commands check whether the phone number given is not just in the correct format given, but also to check that it is:
      1. A valid phone number (e.g. 7 - 15 digits, handling the shortest and longest phone numbers internationally)

2. **Make 'successfully added patient/doctor' message more detailed**
   1. Both commands success message do not show all the details of the patient/doctor added. Specifically:
      1. The `add-patient` command does not show the patient's date of birth and gender
      2. The `add-doctor` command does not show the doctor's speciality
   2. We plan to make the success message show all the details of the patient/doctor added, including those above.

3. **Fixing issues with error messages.**
    1. In the current implementation, some commands display the wrong error message when the user enters an invalid command.
    2. We plan to correct these instances:
       1. `delete-appt` should display "Invalid Unique ID, appointment does not exist." when the index specified is too large, instead of "Invalid command format!". (e.g `delete-appt 1000000000000000000000000`)
       2. `delete` should display "The person index provided is invalid." when index `0` or a negative integer is entered.
       3. `add-patient` should display "Invalid date of birth provided" when the date of birth is not a valid date (e.g 32-04-1995 does not exist), instead of the current generic message "Dates must be in the format of DD-MM-YYYY".
       4. `add-appt` should display "Invalid date provided" when the date is not a valid date (e.g 32-04-1995 does not exist), instead of the current generic message "Dates must be in the format of DD-MM-YYYY".
       5. `add-appt` should display "Invalid time provided" when the time is outside of the range 0000 - 2359, instead of the current generic message "Times must be in the format of HHmm".
       6. Giving invalid tags error messaage needs to be updated to let user know that tags should not only contain alphanumeric characters, but also not contain any spaces.
    3. Some messages also have the term "address book". Though not entirely wrong, we plan to change this to "MediContacts" to maintain consistency with the application's name.

4. **Update `add-doctor` command to take in a wider range of specialties**
   1. Currently, the `add-doctor` command only allows for specialties with no spaces and only alphabets.
   2. We plan to update the command to allow for specialties with spaces and some special characters (e.g. `Cardiovascular Surgeon`, `General Practitioner`, `Orthopedic Surgeon`) to be supported.

5. **Fix `find` command to behave similarly to `find-doctor` and `find-patient`**
   1. Currently, `find` command does not check for invalid input (e.g `find eth1/`), unlike our `find-doctor` and `find-patient` commands.
   2. We plan to update the `find` command to check for invalid input and display an error message if the input has an invalid characters (e.g special characters or numbers).

6. **Implement Maximum Word Count for Fields**
   1. There are no restrictions on the length of fields like name and address, which can lead to excessively long inputs that affect display and usability.
   2. We plan to implement a maximum character count for specific fields:
      1. Name field: Limit to 50 characters to ensure readability and prevent display issues. 
      2. Address field: Limit to 100 characters, allowing detailed addresses without causing layout overflow.
   3. These restrictions will be enforced at both the command parsing level (to provide immediate feedback) and the model level (to ensure consistency).
   4. If the input exceeds the maximum length, the user will receive an error message explaining the character limit.

7. **Increasing the maximum number of appointments.** 
   1. Currently, the maximum number of appointments that can be stored is 10,000.
   2. We plan to increase this limit to a number that cannot be realistically reached, while ensuring the appointment IDs are still concise.
8. **Sort Appointment by Date** 
    1. Currently, the application displays appointments in an unsorted order, which may reduce the usability and effectiveness of the application. To enhance user experience, appointments will be automatically sorted by date. This enhancement will help receptionist view upcoming appointments more easily. 
    2. Sorting of appointments will be in ascending order (earliest to latest).

9. **Fix UI bug regarding date of birth**
    1. Intended Behaviour: For months with less than 31 days, entering a date that is too large but below 32 will be automatically corrected. (e.g. 30-02-2024 will return 29-02-2024)
    2. Current Behaviour: Entering a date that is too large but below 32 will not be automatically corrected in the UI. (e.g. 30-02-2024 will return 30-02-2024). But, the date will be stored correctly in storage, hence restarting the app will show the corrected date.
    3. We plan to fix the UI to display the corrected date immediately after the user enters the date.

10. **Add feature to update patient and doctor records `edit-patient` and `edit-doctor`**
    1. Currently, there is no feature to update patient and doctor records. This feature will allow users to update patient and doctor records when there are changes in their details.
    2. The update feature will allow users to update patient and doctor details such as name, phone number, email, address, date of birth
