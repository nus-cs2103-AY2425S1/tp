## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireme/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireme/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `/delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

> **_NOTE:_** The sequence diagram shows a simplified execution of the DeleteCommand.

<br></br>
Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br></br>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireme/ui/Ui.java).

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `InternshipApplicationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireme/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `InternshipApplication` object residing in the `Model`.

The `HelpWindow` component is shown when you execute a help command. It contains a link to the detailed user and developer guide on this HireMe documentation website.

The `ChartWindow` component is shown when you execute a chart command. It contains a visual representation of the various statuses of your internship applications, in the form of a pie chart.

<br></br>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireme/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser (if necessary) that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete an internship application).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br></br>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireme/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores HireMe data i.e., all `InternshipApplication` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `InternshipApplication` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<InternshipApplication>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
<br></br>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/hireme/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<br></br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.hireme.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Getting help
The implementation of the command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.
In this case, since there are no additional parameters for the help command, `AddressBookParser` does not create any parser object.

<puml src="diagrams/HelpSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="HelpSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` ensures that there are no additional parameters provided. If there are parameters found, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException.
Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `HelpCommand`.

Upon execution, `HelpCommand` returns an instance of `CommandResult` which contains the help message.

> **_NOTE:_** `Model` is not invoked here but included for the sake of clarity.

<br></br>

### Add new internship application
The implementation of the add command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `AddCommandParser` to parse user input string.

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the values corresponding to the prefixes `n/`, `r/`, `e/` and `d/`.
`AddressBookParser` ensures that:
- All values corresponding to the prefixes are valid.
  If any of the above constraints are violated, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `AddCommand` that corresponds to the user input.
`AddCommand` comprises of the internship application to be added, which is an instance of `InternshipApplication`.

Upon execution, `AddCommand` first queries the supplied model if it contains a duplicate internship application. If no duplicate internship application exists, then `AddCommand` adds the internship application into the data.

> **_NOTE:_**  The sequence diagram shows a simplified execution of the AddCommand. HireMe identifies an entry as a duplicate if its `NAME`, `ROLE`, `EMAIL` and `DATE` match **(case-insensitive)** with those of an existing internship application entry. Attempting to add a duplicate will result in an error.

<br></br>

### List all internship applications
The implementation of the list command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

<puml src="diagrams/ListSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ListSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `ListCommand.
Upon execution, `ListCommand` calls on `m::updateFilteredList` to show all internship applications.
> **_NOTE:_** The sequence diagram shows a simplified execution of the ListCommand.

<br></br>

### Delete an internship application

The implementation of the delete command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `DeleteCommandParser` to parse user input string.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="DeleteSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the index from the user's input.
`AddressBookParser` ensures that there is only one parameter found which is a number. If there is no valid parameter found, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException.
Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `DeleteCommand` that corresponds to the user input.
`DeleteCommand` comprises of a `targetIndex` which is the zero based index number of the internship application to be deleted.

Upon execution, `DeleteCommand` gets the internship application to be deleted and calls on `m::deleteItem` which deletes it from the list.
> **_NOTE:_** The sequence diagram shows a simplified execution of the DeleteCommand.

<br></br>

### Update the status of an internship application

The `StatusCommand` updates the status of an internship application to `PENDING`, `ACCEPTED`, or `REJECTED`, triggered by commands `/pending`, `/accept`, or `/reject` respectively. The implementation of the status command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `StatusCommandParser` to parse user input string.

<puml src="diagrams/StatusSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="StatusSequenceDiagram" />

The sequence diagram above illustrates the flow for the `/accept` command. Similar flows apply for `/reject` and `/pending`.

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the index from the user's input.  
`AddressBookParser` ensures that there is only one parameter found, which is a number. If no valid parameter is found, `AddressBookParser` throws a `ParseException`. Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `StatusCommand` based on the user input, with the `StatusCommand` containing the target index and specified status.

Upon execution, `StatusCommand` retrieves the internship application to be updated and calls `m::setItem` to update the status of the internship application.
> **_NOTE:_** The sequence diagram shows a simplified execution of the StatusCommand.

<br></br>
<puml src="diagrams/StatusActivityDiagram.puml" alt="StatusActivityDiagram" />

The activity diagram above outlines the detailed flow for the `StatusCommand`, showing the decision points and actions taken during the command execution.

<br></br>

### Find internship applications
The implementation of the find command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `FindCommandParser` to parse user input string.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FindSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the keyword from the user's input.
`AddressBookParser` ensures that there is at least one keyword found. If there is no keyword found, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException.
Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `FindCommand` that corresponds to the user input.
  `FindCommand` comprises of a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

Upon execution, `FindCommand` calls on `m::updateFilteredList` which in turns calls on `filteredList::setPredicate`.
`setPredicate` updates the `filteredList` in `Model` to contain all the internship applications with company name that starts with the keyword.

<br></br>

### Filter internship applications

The implementation of the filter command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.
`AddressBookParser` creates `FilterCommandParser` to parse user input string.

In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `FilterCommandParser` to parse user input string.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FilterSequenceDiagram"/>

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the status from the user's input.
`AddressBookParser` ensures that the status is found. If there is no status found, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException.

Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `FilterCommand` that corresponds to the user input.
`FilterCommand` comprises of a `StatusPredicate`.

Upon execution, `FilterCommand` passes the instance of `StatusPredicate` to the model through the method `m::updateFilteredList`. The model then uses the predicate internally to update the displayed list of internship applications.

<br></br>

### Sort internship application list
The implementation of the command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

In this case, `AddressBookParser` creates `SortCommandParser` to parse user input string.

<puml src="diagrams/SortSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="SortSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` first obtains the order from the user's input.
`AddressBookParser` ensures that there is only one parameter found which is the sorting order. If there is no valid parameter found, `AddressBookParser` throws a ParseException.
Otherwise, it creates a new instance of `SortCommand` that corresponds to the user input.
`SortCommand` comprises of a `DateComparator` which contains the sorting order, according to date of application, that the internship application list should be sorted by.

Upon execution, `SortCommand` calls on `m::sortFilteredList` which in turns calls on `addressBook::sortItems`which updates the `filteredList` in `Model` to sort the internship applications in the list according to the order specified by the user.

<br></br>

### Clear
The implementation of the command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

<puml src="diagrams/ClearSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ClearSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `ClearCommand`. 
Upon execution, `ClearCommand` calls on `m::setAddressBook` with a new address book that has zero internship applications. Finally, `ClearCommand` generates a `CommandResult` with a confirmation message.
> **_NOTE:_** The sequence diagram shows a simplified execution of the ClearCommand.

<br></br>

### View chart
The implementation of the chart command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

<puml src="diagrams/ChartSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ChartSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `ChartCommand`.
Upon execution, `ChartCommand` gets the chart data which is encapsulated in `CommandResult`.

<br></br>

### Close the application
The implementation of the command follows the convention of a normal command, where `AddressBookParser` is responsible for parsing the user input string into an executable command.

<puml src="diagrams/ExitSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ExitSequenceDiagram" />

`AddressBookParser` creates `ExitCommand`.
Upon execution, `ExitCommand` encapsulates the intent to close the application in `CommandResult`.

> **_NOTE:_** `Model` is not invoked here but included for the sake of clarity.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
The team consists of 5 members.
Given below are enhancements planned for future versions. <br>

1. **Make 'Role' and 'Company Name' in the `add` command less restrictive** 
   - Current behaviour: The current validator is too restrictive on what is allowed as `Role` and `Company Name`. Valid roles such as: C++ Developer, C# Developer, R&D Specialist are currently flagged as invalid by the validator. Similarly, valid company names such as: A*STAR, SK-II, Yahoo!, John's Bakery are also flagged as invalid by the validator. <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: We plan to loosen the restrictions for roles and company names by adjusting the regular expressions allowed. <br></br>
   - Justification: This allows the command to be more inclusive of the possible roles and company names in the real world. <br></br>

2. **Improve consistency in `find` feature** 
   - Current behaviour: The find feature currently allows special characters (e.g., ~\`!@#) to be used as keywords, despite these characters being disallowed in `Company Name`. This inconsistency can lead to a confusing user experience, as searches with these special characters will not yield any results. <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: Implement validation in the find feature to restrict keywords to only valid characters that are allowed in `Company Name`. This will ensure that users can only search using characters that are present in actual company names. <br></br>
   - Justification: By enforcing consistency between allowed characters in `Company Name` and the `find` feature, we improve the user experience by preventing ineffective searches and aligning expectations for valid search terms. <br></br>

3. **Make error message for `add` command more specific** 
   - Current behaviour: The error message provided when the user inputs an invalid `add` command is too generic.
     For example, `/add n/Google r/SWE d/01/01/24` will provide an error message stating `Invalid command format!`. It does not provide additional information to the user, 
on why the command is invalid. The error message could be more specific to state the email field is missing.
   <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: We plan to improve the validator to be able to detect specifically why the command is invalid, and provide a more specific error message. 
   <br></br>
   - Justification: In doing so, users will have a clearer idea on what they did wrong when they typed in the command and they will be able to easily fix the issue. This enables the users to have a more pleasant experience when using HireMe.
   <br></br>

4. **Improve UI to deal with long texts**
   - Current behaviour: The current application does not allow the user to scroll horizontally across the internship application card. Hence, very long text will be cut off and users are unable to see the full text. <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: We plan to allow horizontal scrolling for an internship application card when there are long texts. <br></br>
   - Justification: This lets the user see the full text in application. <br></br>

5. **Improve the validator for `email`**
   - Current behaviour: Although the current email validator accepts most valid email addresses, there are still certain valid email addresses (e.g. `faceb__k@fb.com.sg`) that it might incorrectly flag out as invalid addresses. <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: A fix for the email validator to accept valid emails with more combinations of special characters. <br></br>
   - Justification: Company emails with uncommon combinations of special characters in their email addresses will be considered invalid and hence, users will not be able to include such internship application in the HireMe tracking system. <br></br>

6. **Improve error messaging for `status` commands**
   - Current behaviour: The `/accept`, `/pending`, and `/reject` commands currently return the same generic error message when there’s an error, despite each command serving a distinct purpose. This shared error message does not provide clarity on which specific command failed, potentially confusing the user. <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: Separate error messages for each command (`/accept`, `/pending`, and `/reject`) within the status command to clarify which specific action encountered an error. This will help users understand and correct command-specific errors more effectively. <br></br>
   - Justification: By providing distinct error messages for each command, we improve the user experience by making error feedback more specific and actionable. Users will be able to identify errors related to each command easily, reducing potential confusion and enhancing usability. <br></br>

7. **Improve chart UI** <br>
   <img src="images/chart-ui-bug.png" alt="chart-ui-bug"> <br></br>
   - Current behaviour: When there are multiple statuses with zero internship applications, not all status labels are shown. <br></br>
   - Planned enhancement: Remove chart labels for statuses with zero internship applications. <br></br>
   - Justification: This ensures a consistent and user-friendly chart view which makes it easier for users to interpret the chart. <br></br>
   
8. **Remove the use of popup windows in HireMe**
    - Current behaviour 1: When the HireMe application is in full screen and the help or chart window popup is closed, the entire HireMe application crashes. If it does not crash, repeating these steps a few times will cause the crash to occur.
      For example, when the HireMe application is in full screen, /help or /chart will open up a help or a chart window respectively. Closing the popup window when the application is in full screen will cause the entire HireMe application to crash.
      <br></br>
    - Current behaviour 2: When the help or chart windows are minimized, executing /help or /chart will not reopen the popup windows respectively.
      For example, similarly, when a user types in /help, minimizes the help window and tries to open it with /help again, the help window does not reopen. This also occurs when the user carries out the same steps with the chart window.
      <br></br>
    - Planned enhancement: We plan to display help and chart content directly in the main application window rather than as popups. Users can return to the main list by typing /list, eliminating these popup issues.
      <br></br>
    - Justification: This change will prevent crashes, improve reliability and resolve the issues above, creating a smoother user experience in HireMe.
      <br></br>
   
9. **User confirmation for `clear` command**
    - Current behaviour: The `clear` command clears all internship applications without asking for user confirmation. <br></br>
    - Planned enhancement: HireMe to prompt the user for confirmation on `clear` command. If the user confirms, then all internship applications will be cleared. Otherwise, no action will be taken and the internship applications remain. <br></br>
    - Justification: HireMe does not support any form of undo action and hence, there is no safety mechanism against accidental clearing of internship applications by the user. By having a confirmation, it ensures that `clear` is only carried out deliberately. <br></br>
   
10. **Backup file for storage**
    - Current behaviour: Internship applications data is stored in a single data file `hireme.json`. <br></br>
    - Planned enhancement: A backup file that replicates the data in `hireme.json`. <br></br>
    - Justification: Having only a single data file to store internship applications data means having a single point of failure when the data in corrupted or lost. A backup file that synchronously replicates the data in `hireme.json` ensures data redundancy. <br></br>
