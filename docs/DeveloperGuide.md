## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ReminderListDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object and `Reminder` residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the reminder address book data i.e., all `Reminder` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueReminderList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, reminder address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `ReminderAddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

``This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.``

### Save Sort Preference

<img src="images/SaveSortPreferenceSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

The "Save Sort Preference" feature allows users to save their preferred sorting method for NetBook so that the next time
they open the application, their contacts are displayed in the saved order. This feature consists of multiple components working
together, including the Logic and Model component.
The implementation is similar to the `Delete` command above, with a few additional details 

#### Flow of Save Sort Preference
1. **User Command**: The process begins with users entering the command `svp high` or other valid save sort command.
2. *Command Parsing*:
   1. The `AddressBookParser` parses the command and identifies the `SaveSortPreferenceCommandParser` which is the parser
    responsible for handling this specific command.
   2. The `SaveSortPreferenceCommandParser` then calls the class method `ParserUtil::parseSortPreference`. The job of `ParserUtil::parseSortPreference`
   is to validate and process the input passed by the NetBook user. Note that the validity of the saveSortPreference input is then handled by
   the class method `SortPreference::isValidSortPreference` that is present in the model component. 
3. **Saving the Preference**
   1. The parsed `SortPreference` object will be passed to the `SaveSortPreferenceCommand` class, which executes the saving operation
   2. The `Model` class stored the user's sorting preference persistently
   3. Note that the sorting preference is finally stored in `UserPrefs` as a String
4. **Result**: A `CommandResult` is generated and returned to the `LogicManager`, indicating either success or failure

### Sort Command

The `Sort` command allows users to change the ordering of the contacts based on priority and the last seen date.
The feature works by leveraging the ObservableList class provided by the JavaFX library, similiar the the `Find` command.
Where the `Find` command uses `FilteredList`, `Sort` uses `SortedList`.

<img src="images/SortCommandSimpleSequence.png" width="600">

The sequence diagram of the Sort Command is typical of other commands. 
The notable aspect of the diagram is that the `SortedList` in the `model` is updated with a new comparator. 
In the case of `sort high`, the comparator is `PriorityHighToLowComparator`.

<img src="images/ContactDisplaySequencyDiagram.png" width="600">

As shown above, the `UI` displays the list of contacts as contained in the `FilteredList` in the `Model`.

To ensure the changes to the `SortedList` is visible to the `UI`, persons are initialised from the `AddressBook` into the `SortedList`. 
The `SortedList` is used to populate the `FilteredList`. This way, any changes made to the `SortedList` is visible in the UI via the `FilteredList`.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: School of Computing students

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts of other students, recruiters, potential employers in
networking events
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast due to the nature of their course
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Allows SoC students to quickly and easily manage the relationships they form with others in
school and on their journey to acquire internships. SoC students are likely to prefer a CLI due to their background 
in computing. Also, they can most likely type fast.

   1. **Test case**: `save_sort high`
      **Expected**: The list of persons is sorted by priority with high_priority contacts at the top, and this preference is 
      saved. Upon restarting the application, the contact list should reflect this order.
   1. **Test case**: `svp distant`
      **Expected**: The list is sorted by `last seen` dates from most distant to most recent. After restarting the application, 
      this sorting preference is retained and automatically applied to the contacts list.

      `low`, etc.)
      **Expected**: Error messages similar to the previous cases, and the saved preference remains unchanged.
1. **Verifying persistence of saved preferences**
   1. **Prerequisites**: Have already saved a sort preference (e.g, `save_sort recent` or `svp high`).
   1. **Test case**: Close the application and re-launch it.
      **Expected**: The contacts list should automatically display according to the saved preference

## **Appendix: Effort**
1. Unlike AB3, which deals primarily with single entity type (Person), our project involves multiple entity types, such as
entity types such as Persons, and Reminders, each with their own attributes and functionality. This added complexity required 
us to design different classes and interfaces to handle each entity type effectively, as well as implementing additional
features to support interactions between them. Hence, this increased the overall difficulty and effort required, as it 
demanded additional design consideration and testing.
2. The UI design also required substantial effort. Unlike AB3, where data was primarily displayed as a list of persons, our project 
needed to display multiple types of information (e.g., Persons, Reminders). Designing an intuitive UI that could handle these features
without overwhelming the user took significant planning and iterative refinement.
3. One key challenge was using JavaFX for the UI, as it was a new technology for our team. Despite we had briefly touched on JavaFX in
IP, we still had more to learn in TP. The steep learning curve of JavaFx added to the overall effort and required us to invest
large amount of time learning it.
4. A significant portion of effort was dedicated to implementing a variety of commands that allow users to perform tasks such as adding
, editing, deleting, sorting, and finding persons, as well as adding and removing reminders. We had to ensure that these commands worked
seamlessly together, along with proper error handling, and testing added to the overall complexity of the project.
   1. Fortunately, we were able to save efforts by leveraging on the underlying structure of AB3, such as the command patterns.
   The Reminder field was built using similar structure as the addressBookStorage implemented by the existing AB3.
5. In terms of achievements, we successfully delivered a fully functional product that was close to what we had envision from
the start, including complex features like the reminder feature that seemed daunting at first. We also gained valuable insights to Java,
learning about new classes like the `ObservableList` class, which was essential for dynamically updating the UI when changes occured in the
underlying data. Additionally, working with JavaFX expanded our understanding of building graphical user interfaces.


## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Team Size: 5
1. **Make 'failed add' message more specific**: Currently, when an add command
fails due to missing parameters,<br>
`Invalid command format!
add: Adds a person to the address book. Parameters: n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL o/ORGANIZATION [d/LAST SEEN] [t/TAG]... [pr/PRIORITY] [r/REMARK]
Example: add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com o/NUS d/23-09-2024 t/friends t/owesMoney pr/low r/likes apple `<br>
is used as the error message. This can be lengthy and too general. Instead, a more specific message that pinpoints the
exact error can be used. For instance `add n/Joe p/82828282 e/Joe@gmail.com pr/high r/internship supervisor` does not work
because there is a missing `organisation` field, an error like `missing organisation field` can be shown instead.
2. **Adding confirmation after clear command is used**: Currently NetBook allows users to clear all persons and reminders using either the
command `clear` or `c`. However, as the command is relatively simple, it may lead to unintended deletion of all data in NetBook.
In future iterations, we plan to add a confirmation step after the `clear` command is executed to prevent accidental data loss. This
extra step allow users to reconsider and avoid unintended deletion.
3. **Include cascading delete of reminders that are tagged to a person**: Reminders are specific to a certain person in the contacts.
Currently, deleting a person does not remove all the reminders associated to the person, and NetBook users will have to use the `dr`
command to delete reminders 1 by 1. We plan to make NetBook automatically remove all reminders associated with that person when the person is
deleted.
4. **Distinguish remark command to add additional remarks without overwriting**: Currently, both the
`edit` and `remark` commands perform the same function. To add unique functionality, we plan to modify the `remark` command so that it
appends a new note without overwriting the existing remark. This enhancement aims to allow user to keep multiple remarks for a person, while
the `edit` command will enable replacing a specified remark of a person.
5. **Add edit reminder feature**: Currently, users of NetBook will have to delete a reminder and add a new reminder if they found
a mistake in the original reminder they created. We plan to introduce an `edit reminder` feature, allowing users to modify the
fields of the reminder directly. This helps to make managing reminders more efficient.
6. **Enable partial matching in find command**: Currently, when using the `find` command, the search keyword must exactly match the
full name or organisation field to locate a person. We plan to enhance this by enabling partial matching, allowing users to find contacts even if they
enter only part of the name or organisation. This helps make searching more flexible and user-friendly.
7. **Make `date error` message more specific**: Currently, the error message for an invalid date input is `Date input is incorrect.
Please check if the date is valid and follows the DD-MM-YYYY format`. For example `remind 2 d/1-02-2025 des/interview at ABC corp` will result in an error because the day should be a 2-digit number, while
`remind 2 d/30-02-2025 des/interview at ABC corp` triggers an error because 30th February 2025 does not exist. We plan to make the error more specific to pinpoint the exact error in the
date, helping users identify and correct errors more easily.
8. **Clearer sort success message**: Currently, regardless of the `sort` command, if the list of persons is successfully sorted,
the message `Persons list has been sorted` will be shown. We plan to make the success message more specific by including sorting criterion, 
such as `Persons list has been sorted by [criterion]`. This will provide users with clearer feedback on how their data has been sorted.
9. **Improve UI colour contrast**: Currently, the user interface may have areas where the contrast between text and background colours is
insufficient, making it difficult for some users to read or interact with the application. We plan to improve the colour contrast of 
the UI of NetBook in future iterations.
10. **Limit character length for fields except remark and reminder**: Currently, only the remark and reminder fields have text wrapping 
capabilities. Hence, if NetBook users were to enter long texts for fields like `organisation`, `tags`, `phone`, or `email`, do not handle
long input errors. We plan to implement a character length limit for these fields to ensure they remain manageable and visually consistent.
This will help prevent users from entering excessively long text that could disrupt the layout.
