## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14a-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14a-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14a-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14a-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.


Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14a-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="800" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14a-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add a new student

[//]: # (First three paragraphs below inspired by https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t08-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#add-details)

The add command is used to add a new student to the address book. The `AddCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating an `AddCommand` object. The `AddCommand` object is then executed by the `Logic` component.

`AddCommandParser` obtains the values corresponding to the prefixes `n/` `p/` `e/` `a/` `t/` `s/` `r/` `paid/` `owed/` from the user input. The `AddCommandParser` will enforce the following constraints:
* There is no preamble text between the `add` command word and the prefixes.
* The prefixes `n/` `p/` `e/` `a/` `t/` `s/` `r/` must be provided (`paid/` and `owed/` are optional).
* If the prefixes are provided, they must appear for only once.
* All values corresponding to the prefixes that are provided must be non-empty and valid.

If the constraints are not met, the `AddCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` with an error message indicating the constraint that was violated.
Otherwise, a new instance of `Student` is created with the values obtained from the user input.
A new instance of `AddCommand` is then created with the `Student` instance.

On execution, `AddCommand` first queries the supplied model if it contains a student with both an identical name **and** an identical phone number. If no such student exists, `AddCommand` then calls on `model::addStudent` to add the student into the addressBook data.

Finally, `AddCommand` queries the model to see if the student's schedule clashes with others in the address book. If conflicts are found, a warning message is displayed along with the conflicting students.

The following diagram summarizes how a user may add a student into UGTeach.

<puml src="diagrams/UserAddCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="UserAddCommandActivityDiagram" width="600"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an add operation goes through the `Logic` component:
<puml src="diagrams/ParseArgsToGetStudentFieldReferenceFrame.puml" alt="ParseArgsToGetStudentFieldReferenceFrame"/>
<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="AddSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Similarly, how an AddCommand operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="AddSequenceDiagram-Model" height="500"/>



#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How add command is carried out:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Key in all the details for student in one command.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, as only one command needs to be key in by user.
  * Cons: Command might get too long.

* **Alternative 2:** Key in the details for students in multiple steps.
  * Pros: A step-by-step guide for adding details can be especially helpful for new users, as it offers clear and structured guidance.
  * Cons: It is hard to implement, especially with a mix of optional and compulsory fields.
  Additionally, it is not user-friendly for fast typists, as multiline commands are required to add a student.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Owe tuition fees

[//]: # (Lines 236 - 251 inspired by https://ay2324s1-cs2103t-t08-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#add-details)

The owe command is part of UGTeach's payment tracking feature. It is used to track the amount of tuition fee owed by a student. The `OweCommandParser` is responsible for parsing the user input and creating an `OweCommand` object. The `OweCommand` object is then executed by the `Logic` component.

`OweCommandParser` obtains the `INDEX` of the student and the values corresponding to the prefix `hr/` from the user input. The `OweCommandParser` will enforce the following constraints:
* The `INDEX` must be a positive integer.
* The prefix `hr/` must be provided.
* If the prefixes are provided, they must appear for only once.
* Value corresponding to the prefix that is provided must be non-empty and valid (positive multiple of 0.5).

If the constraints are not met, the `OweCommandParser` will throw a `ParseException` with an error message indicating the constraint that was violated.
Otherwise, a new instance of `OweCommand` is then created with the values of `INDEX` and `HOURS_OWED` parsed by `OweCommandParser`.

On execution, `OweCommand` first queries the supplied model for the student to be updated using the `INDEX`.

Then, `OweCommand` calculates the amount of tuition fee owed and checks if the total amount owed by the student exceeds the limit of `9999999.99`. If it exceeds, `OweCommand` will throw a `CommandException` with an error message indicating that limit was violated.

Finally, `OweCommand` updates the total amount of tuition fee owed by the student by creating a new `Student` instance with updated fields to replace the outdated `Student` instance in the model.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user wants to track payment after a lesson:
<puml src="diagrams/PaymentTrackingActivityDiagram.puml" width="750"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

How an OweCommand operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/OweSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="OweSequenceDiagram-Model" height="1400" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How owe executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calculations for amount owed done by UGTeach.
    * Pros: User friendly.
    * Cons: May have performance issues due to the need to fetch data and perform calculations.

* **Alternative 2:** Calculations for amount owed done by the user.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Might not be user-friendly as user would need to find out what is the
    tuition rate charged and calculate how much tuition fee did the student owe.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancement**

Given below are the planned enhancements for UGTeach (to be implemented in the future).

**Team size: 5**

1. **Make Add Command fields shorter:** The current `add command` has 7 compulsory parameters which might be tedious and long even for users who can type fast.
We plan to make the `add command` shorter by making the `email` field **optional**. This is the **new format:**
`add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER a/ADDRESS t/SCHEDULE s/SUBJECT r/RATE [e/EMAIL] [paid/PAID_AMOUNT] [owed/OWED_AMOUNT]`, where parameters in square brackets are optional.


1. **Improve duplicate detection to meet real-world use cases**: The current version only considers students with **both** the same name and the same phone number as duplicates. We take the 2 fields as the main criteria for differentiating students, since different students may have the exact same name. However, the email address could also serve as a unique identifier for students. <br>
   In the future version, we plan to include email address as another criterion for detecting duplicates. To be specific,
   * Two students with the same name and the same phone number are duplicates;
   * Two students with the same name and the same email address are duplicates;
   * Two students with different names, but the same phone number or the same email address, are acceptable. <br>
    
    The following code snippet shows how 2 students are differentiated. Specifically, this will be the updated `isSameStudent` method of the `Student` class.
    ```java
    public boolean isSameStudent(Student otherStudent) {
        if (otherStudent == this) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (otherStudent == null || !otherStudent.getName().equals(getName())) {
            return false;
        }

        return otherStudent.getPhone().equals(getPhone())
                || getEmail() == null
                || otherStudent.getEmail().equals(getEmail());
    }
    ```


1. **Allow students to have multiple classes:** Currently, UGTeach only allow 1 student to have 1 subject and 1 schedule. UGTeach also forbid users from duplicating contacts.
Hence, users are unable to record multiple classes for students who require tutoring for **more than one subject**.
Therefore, we plan to combine the `subject` and `schedule` parameters to form a `class` parameter that takes in 1 or more classes (comma-separated). For instance, the input
`edit 1 class/Mathematics Monday-1500-1600, Science Wednesday-1200-1400` would mean the first student in UGTeach is receiving tutoring
for Mathematics on Monday (1500-1600) and Science on Wednesday (1200-1400).


1. **Allow phone numbers from other countries:** Currently, UGTeach only allows Singapore phone numbers as we assumed that students (local or international) should have a Singapore number.
However, the user might provide tuition to international students who do not have a Singapore number.
Hence, we plan to **ease the restriction on phone numbers** to allow phone numbers **ranging from 3-digits to 17-digits** since the shortest and longest
phone number in the world are 3 and 17 digits long respectively, according to the [World Population Review](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/phone-number-length-by-country).


1. **Improve UI to be horizontally scrollable**: Currently, UGTeach only allows vertical scrolling as it is unlikely for students to have an extremely long name or email.
Hence, 'extreme' inputs (e.g., name with 1000 characters) are **truncated** which might interfere with the normal usage of UGTeach.
Therefore, we plan to improve the UI by **adding a horizontal scroll bar** so that users can view 'extreme' inputs.


1. **Allow negative HOURS_OWED for `owe`:** Currently, UGTeach only allow **positive multiples of 0.5** for the hours specified in the `owe command`. Hence, if users have used the `owe command` on mistake,
   e.g. keyed in the wrong number of hours, the only way for user to revert back to the previous amount owed by the student is through remembering the previous amount owed, and edit the student's `owedAmount` field using the `edit command`.
   This might be inconvenient for the user, as the user might not remember the previous amount that was owed by the student.
   Therefore, we plan to allow **negative multiples of 0.5** for the hours specified in the `owe command`. If users were to make a mistake in the `owe command`, he can enter the same `owe command`, but with the negative hours specified.
   e.g. User typed `owe 1 hr/2` wrongly, when he wants to increase the owed amount of the student by 3 hours * `rate` instead.
   He can first type `owe 1 hr/-2` to 'undo' the previous owe command, and type `owe 1 hr/3` this time for the correct update.
   Special cases that we handle:
    * hr/0 will still not be accepted.
    * When the resulting owed amount of the student that user want to update is less than 0, the command will not be executed and an error message will be shown.
      The main purpose for allowing negative hours for `owe command` is to allow user to 'undo' his mistakes made due to him specifying the wrong number of hours owed by the student.
      Hence, the resulting owed amount from the execution of the `owe command` should not be negative in any daily use case.<br><br>

1. **Integrate `pay` and `settle` command to reduce user confusion:** In the current version, the `pay` command adds the student's payment to the paid amount, while the `settle` command subtracts the amount repaid from the owed amount and adds to the paid amount. Having two commands for the two similar use cases might confuse new users.
    * In the future version, we plan to integrate the 2 commands into 1 command: `pay hr/HOURS_PAID | amount/AMOUNT`.
        * To be specific, the new `pay` command accepts either `hr/HOURS_PAID` or `amount/AMOUNT` but not both and there must be exactly one argument given.
        * `hr/HOURS_PAID` specifies number of hours the student **pays** for, and the amount of `HOURS_PAID * RATE` will be added to the paid amount.
        * `amount/AMOUNT` specifies the amount the student **repays**, which will be subtracted from the owed amount then added to the paid amount.
    * By integrating the 2 features into 1 command, the user can focus on reading the instructions of 1 command and choosing which option they want instead of trying one of them then finding out that it is not what they want. <br>

1. **Allow negative HOURS_PAID and negative AMOUNT for the new `pay` command `pay hr/HOURS_PAID | amount/AMOUNT`:** Currently, UGTeach only allows **positive multiples of 0.5** for the hours specified in the `pay command`. Hence, if users have used the `pay command` on mistake,
   e.g. keyed in the wrong number of hours, the only way for user to revert back to the previous amount paid by the student is through remembering the previous amount paid, and edit the student's `paidAmount` field using the `edit command`.
   This might be inconvenient for the user, as the user might not remember the previous amount that was paid by the student.
   Therefore, we plan to allow **negative multiples of 0.5** for the hours specified in the `pay` command. If users were to make a mistake in the `pay command`, he can enter the same `pay command`, but with the negative hours specified.
   e.g. User typed `pay 1 hr/2` wrongly, when he wants to increase the paid amount of the student by 3 hours * `rate` field of that student instead.
   He can first type `pay 1 hr/-2` to "undo" the previous `pay command`, and type `pay 1 hr/3` this time for the correct update.
   Special cases that we handle:
    * `hr/0` will still not be accepted.
    * When the resulting paid amount of the student that user want to update is less than 0, the command will not be executed and an error message will be shown.
     
    Similarly, we plan to also allow a **negative number with at most 2 decimal places** as a valid AMOUNT when the user needs to "undo" the previous settlement of the owed amount.
    Special cases that we handle:
    * `amount/0` will still not be accepted.
    *  When the resulting paid amount of the student that the user want to update is less than 0, the command will not be executed and an error message will be shown.


    The main purpose for allowing negative hours and negative amount for the new `pay command` is to allow user to "undo" his mistakes made due to him specifying the wrong number of hours paid or the wrong amount settled by the student.
    Hence, the resulting paid amount from the execution of the `pay command` should not be negative in any daily use case.


1. **Enforce double confirmation for clear command:** The current `clear command` clears all the students in the list without any confirmation from the user.
    This might be inconvenient for the user, as the user might accidentally type the `clear command` and lose all the students' data.
    Therefore, we plan to enforce a double confirmation for the `clear command`. When the user types the `clear command`, UGTeach will prompt the user to confirm the deletion of all students in the list.
    The user will have to type `yes` (case-insensitive) to confirm the deletion of all students in the list. If the user types anything else, the deletion will not be executed. Even typing `y` will not be accepted as confirmation, to prevent accidental deletion of all students in the list.
    While this might be slightly inconvenient for the fast typists, as the user will have to type more to confirm the deletion of all students in the list, this will prevent accidental deletion of all students in the list, thereby reducing the risk of complete data loss.
    We believe that the benefits of preventing accidental deletion of all students in the list outweigh the slight inconvenience of having to type more to confirm the deletion of all students in the list.

1. **Enhance storage component to save data in a backup file**: Assuming user have not changed the `preferences.json` file, the current storage component for UGTeach only saves data in the `ugteach.json` file. If the `ugteach.json` file is corrupted or deleted, **all** the data will be lost.
    This might be inconvenient for the user, as the user might accidentally delete the `ugteach.json` file or the file might be corrupted due to some reasons.
    Therefore, we plan to save data in a backup file named `ugteachbackup.json`. The `ugteachbackup.json` file will be updated whenever the `ugteach.json` file is updated.
    The read and write operations will be done only on the `ugteach.json` file, while the `ugteachbackup.json` file will only be updated when the application needs to save the data.
    If the `ugteach.json` file is corrupted or deleted, the user can restore the data from the `ugteach_backup.json` file.
    This will prevent accidental data loss due to the deletion or corruption of the `ugteach.json` file.<br>
    Example of the two files:<br>

    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

    The following code snippet shows the planned enhancement for the storage component to save data in a backup file. Specifically, this will be the updated `saveAddressBook` method for `JsonAddressBookStorage` class.
    ```java
    public void saveAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook addressBook, Path filePath) throws IOException {
         requireNonNull(addressBook);
         requireNonNull(filePath);

         // Save to the primary file
         FileUtil.createIfMissing(filePath);
         JsonUtil.saveJsonFile(new JsonSerializableAddressBook(addressBook), filePath);

         // Create backup file path with "backup" before ".json"
         String fileName = filePath.getFileName().toString();
         String backupFileName = fileName.replace(".json", "backup.json");
         Path backupFilePath = filePath.resolveSibling(backupFileName);

         // Save to the backup file
         FileUtil.createIfMissing(backupFilePath);
         JsonUtil.saveJsonFile(new JsonSerializableAddressBook(addressBook), backupFilePath);
     }
    ```
    This code snippet will handle the case even when user have changed their `addressBookFilePath` in the `preferences.json` file. The backup file will be saved in the **same directory** as the primary file, with the same name as the primary file, but with `"backup"` before `".json"`.
    The user will be informed of the backup file location and be recommended to only edit the primary data file, and not the backup file.<br>
    While the amount of storage needed might be slightly larger due to the backup file, this will prevent accidental data loss due to the deletion or corruption of the primary data file. Also, for our standalone application, the amount of storage needed for the backup file will likely not be significant, as the data stored in the `ugteach.json` file is likely not large.
