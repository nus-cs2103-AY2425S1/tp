## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.
</div>

      in the person list with amount $1.23.

   4. Test case: `filterTxn 0`<br>
      Expected: Current displayed transaction list will remain the same. Error details shown in the status message.

   5. Other incorrect edit commands to try: `filterTxn desc/`, `filterTxn x` (where x is larger than the list size),
      `filterTxn amt/1.222`<br>

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Prerequisites: Multiple persons in `addressbook.json` and multiple transactions in `transactionbook.json` data files.<br>
   
   2. Test cases: Missing `name` field in `addressbook.json` data file<br>
      Simulation: Remove the `name` field from a person entry in the JSON file, then start the app.<br>
      Expected: The person is discarded and not loaded to the app, with log message `WARNING: Address book is possibly corrupted: Person's Name field is missing! Ignoring corrupted person.`. If the corrupted person has any related transactions in the transaction book, they will be discarded accordingly with log message `WARNING: Transaction book is possibly corrupted: Person with id [Person-ID] not found! Ignoring corrupted transactions.` - `[Person-ID]` will be the respective person ID of the corrupted person.

   3. Test cases: Missing `isDone` field in `transactionbook.json` data file<br>
      Simulation: Remove the `isDone` field from a transaction entry in the JSON file, then start the app.<br>
      Expected: The transaction loads as not done by default. Upon closing the app, the transaction is saved as not done in the JSON file.
