# WedLinker Developer Guide

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Acknowledgements**

WedLinker is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org). <br>
The following java classes in the directory `tp\src\main\java\seedu\address\model\task` were taken from one of our team member's [CS2103T Individual Project (IP)](https://github.com/DanzaSeah/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/task). These classes were modified to align with the requirements of the project
- Task, Todo, Deadline, Event <br>

ChatGPT by OpenAI was used by DanzaSeah to:
- Rephrase the JavaDocs of Task and Tag related classes to be more concise and clear,
- Seek suggestions for organising and improving existing test cases,
- Come up with better or more appropriate class and method names.

External Java libraries were also used in the project for various functionalities:
- JavaFX: for the GUI
- JUnit5: for Unit testing
- Jackson: for processing JSON files

## **Design**

### Architecture
The ***Architecture Diagram*** given below explains the high-level design of the App, giving a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.
<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

**Main components of the architecture**
The bulk of the app's work is done by the `UI`, `Logic`, `Model`, and `Storage` components.

* **`Main`**:
    * Consists of classes 
<a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java" style="text-decoration: underline;">`Main`</a>
<a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java" style="text-decoration: underline;">`MainApp`</a>
    * Responsible for app launch and shutdown.
    * At launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence and connects them.
    * At shutdown, it terminates the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.


* <a href="#ui-component" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>UI</code></strong></a>:
    * The interface of the app (WedLinker) that the user primarily interacts with.
    * Displays relevant information (e.g., wedding details) from `Model`.
    * Receives commands from user input.


* <a href="#logic-component" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>Logic</code></strong></a>:
    * The command executor.


* <a href="#model-component" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>Model</code></strong></a>:
    * Holds the data of the app in memory, which can be altered by commands.
    * Some data is displayed to the user via the UI.


* <a href="#storage-component" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>Storage</code></strong></a>:
    * Reads data from, and writes data to, the locally stored `data/addressbook.json` file.


* <a href="#common-classes" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>Commons</code></strong></a>:
    * Represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as `{Component}`.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI Component
(<a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>Ui.java</strong></code></a>)

The `UI` component handles interactions between the user and the app's graphical interface, leveraging JavaFX to define and display various UI elements.

1. **Structure**:
    * The `UI` consists of a `MainWindow` composed of several parts like `CommandBox`, `StatusBarFooter`, `ResultDisplay`, and various `*ListPanel`s.
    * Each UI part, including `MainWindow`, inherits from the abstract class
      (<a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/UiPart.java#L15" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>UiPart</strong></code></a>),
   capturing commonalities among visible GUI components.


2. **Class Diagram**:
    * Diagram showing the `UI` structure:

      <puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

    
3. **JavaFX and Layout Files**:
    * The layout of each UI part is defined using `.fxml` files in the
      <a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>src/main/resources/view</strong></code></a>,
    * For example, the structure of
      <a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>MainWindow</strong></code></a>,
   is specified in
      <a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>MainWindow.fxml</strong></code></a>,


4. **Responsibilities**:
    * Executes user commands by interfacing with the `Logic` component.
    * Listens for updates to `Model` data to refresh the UI with modified information.
    * Maintains a reference to `Logic`, relying on it for command execution.
    * Accesses specific `Model` classes to display `Person` objects managed within `Model`.

### Logic Component
(<a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>Logic.java</strong></code></a>)


The `Logic` component processes user inputs passed through the UI, utilizing a series of parsers to generate `Command` instances, which are then executed. Hereâ€™s an overview:

1. **User Input Processing**:
    * User input is received from the UI and passed to `Logic`.
    * The input is parsed by `AddressBookParser`, which delegates to the appropriate parser (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`), creating the relevant `Command` instance.
    * `LogicManager` executes the `Command`, interacting with the `Model` to make necessary updates (e.g., deleting a person).
    * Execution results are encapsulated in a `CommandResult` and returned to `Logic`, which relays the outcome back to the UI.


2. **Class Diagram**:
    * Partial diagram of the `Logic` component:

      <puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

    
3. **Sequence Diagram**:
    * Example interaction in the `Logic` component for `execute("delete 1")` (from user inputting delete 1 on UI):

      <puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

      <box type="info" seamless>
      
      **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a PlantUML limitation, it continues to the end of the diagram.
      </box>

    
4. **Parser Classes**:
    * Other classes in `Logic` handle command parsing:

      <puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

    * Parsing flow:
        * `AddressBookParser` identifies the specific command parser needed (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`).
        * Each `XYZCommandParser` (e.g., `AddCommandParser`) implements the `Parser` interface, allowing for consistent handling and testing.
        * The parser processes the user command, creating the relevant `Command` object (e.g., `AddCommand`), which `AddressBookParser` returns to `Logic`.

### Model Component
(<a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>Model.java</strong></code></a>)


The `Model` component handles the data and state management for the app, storing all entities and providing an interface for accessing and updating them.

1. **Structure**:
    * The `Model` stores various types of data:
        * `Person` objects within a `UniquePersonList`.
        * `Wedding` objects within a `UniqueWeddingList`.
        * `Tag` objects within a `UniqueTagList`.
        * `Task` objects within a `UniqueTaskList`.


2. **Class Diagram**:
    * Diagram of the `Model` structure:

      <puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />

    
3. **Responsibilities**:
    * **Data Storage**:
        * Maintains address book data, including lists of `Person`, `Wedding`, `Tag` and `Task` objects.
    * **Filtered Views**:
        * Provides filtered lists of `Person` objects (e.g., search results), exposing these as an unmodifiable `ObservableList`. This allows the UI to automatically update in response to changes.
    * **User Preferences**:
        * Stores user preferences in a `UserPref` object, which is accessible externally as `ReadOnlyUserPref`.
    * **Independence**:
        * The `Model` does not rely on other components, as it represents the appâ€™s core data entities, which should be logically self-contained.


### Storage component
(<a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>Storage.java</strong></code></a>)

1. **Functionality**:
    * Supports saving and loading both address book data and user preferences as JSON files.
    * Reads JSON data into corresponding in-memory objects for the app's use.


2. **Inheritance**:
    * Inherits from `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, allowing it to be used interchangeably with either interface, depending on the functionality needed.


3. **Dependencies**:
    * Depends on classes within the `Model` component, as `Storage` is tasked with saving and retrieving `Model`-related objects.


4. **Class Diagram**:
    * Diagram illustrating `Storage` structure:

      <puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="900" />
    
### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the 
<a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>seedu.address.commons</strong></code></a>
package.

Notable classes include `StringUtil` and `ToStringBuilder` which help to perform operations like checking whether a string
includes non-zero unsigned integer, or whether there is a partial match for a word. These can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/util" style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><code>seedu.address.commons.util</strong></code></a>.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Force Feature

The Force feature is a quality of life addition for WedLinker. It enables users to bypass certain checks in the `Logic` in a controlled manner to make usage easier.
The force feature is applicable for the following commands:
* `Tag`: Creates a `Tag` if it does not exist in WedLinker before tagging the `Person`.
* `Delete Tag`: Unassigns the target `Tag` from all contacts before deleting it.
* `Assign Wedding`: Creates a `Wedding` if it does not exist in WedLinker before assigning the `Person` to the `Wedding`.
* `Delete Wedding`: Unassigns all `Person` from the `Wedding` before deleting it.
* `Unassign Vendor`: Unassigns all `Task` from the `Vendor` before making the `Vendor` a `Person`.

#### Implementation

The force functionality can be used with the above functions by including f/ at the end of the command. Additional inputs following the f/ are extraneous and would be discarded.

Example usage: delete-tag t/Photographer f/

Step 1. The user executes `delete-tag t/Photographer f/`.

Step 2. The parser will search through the user input to find f/. f/ is implemented as a `Prefix`. User inputs after f/ will be ignored.

Step 3. The parser will construct the `DeleteTagCommand` differently based on the presence of the force flag.

Step 4. During `DeleteTagCommand#execute()`, the force flag is checked. If present, it unassigns all `Persons` with the `Tag` Photographer before deleting Photographer.

### Tag Feature

The Tag Feature allows users to store additional details of a Person in WedLinker.
Tags support the following functions:

* `Create Tag`â€‰â€”â€‰Creates a `Tag` in WedLinker to be used as additional information of any `Person`.
* `Tag`â€‰â€”â€‰Assigns `Tag` to a `Person.
* `Untag`â€‰â€”â€‰Unassigns a `Tag` from a `Person`.
* `Delete Tag`â€‰â€”â€‰Deletes the `Tag` from WedLinker.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how Tags are used in WedLinker.

Step 1. The user launches the application, `Tags` are loaded into the `Model`.

Step 2. The user executes `create-tag t/Photographer`. WedLinker will check if `Photographer` already exist. 
WedLinker will create a Tag based on the name provided if the `Tag` does not exist. In this case: `Photographer`.

Step 3. The user executes `tag 1 t/Photographer` to tag the first `Person` with `Photographer`.

Step 4. The user executes `list-tags` to view all `Tags` in WedLinker. This will switch the right panel to a Tag view.

Step 5. The user executes `find t/Photographer` to find all `Person` that has the tag of `Photographer`.

Step 6. The user executes `untag 1 t/Photographer`. WedLinker removes the `Photographer` tag from the first person.

Step 7. The user executes `delete-tag t/Photographer`. WedLinker deletes the `Photographer` tag.

<box type="info" seamless>
Tag supports the force functionality for easier usage.

Force is supported for the following functions:
- `Tag` (Creates the Tag if it does not already exist in WedLinker.)
- `Delete Tag` (Unassigns all Person from the Tag before it is deleted.)
  </box>

<box type="warning" seamless>
Known bugs:
- Tag names with very long names overflow in the People view. No issues to functionality. 
  Longer tag names can be viewed as truncated in the Tag view. Tag view can be accessed using the list-tags command.
  Alternatively, use `Task` to write longer information.
</box>

### Wedding Feature

The Wedding Feature allows users to store details of a Wedding in WedLinker. Wedding contains the Contacts involved to facilitate easy planning and consolidation for wedding planners.
Wedding would support the following functions:

* `Create Wedding`â€‰â€”â€‰Creates a Wedding in WedLinker to allow compilation of information.
* `Assign Wedding`â€‰â€”â€‰Assigns `Person` to a Wedding. This can be the `Partners` or `Guest`.
* `Edit Wedding`â€‰â€”â€‰Edits the information for a Wedding. Editable information includes the `Wedding Name`, `Address` and `Date`.
* `Unassign Wedding`â€‰â€”â€‰Unassigns a `Person` from a Wedding.
* `Delete Wedding`â€‰â€”â€‰Deletes the Wedding from WedLinker.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how Weddings are used in WedLinker.

Step 1. The user launches the application, `Weddings` are loaded into the `Model`.

Step 2. The user executes `create-wedding w/Test Wedding 1`. WedLinker will create a Wedding based on the name provided. In this case: `Test Wedding 1`.

Step 3. The user executes `assign-wedding 1 w/Test Wedding 1` to assign a `Person` to `Test Wedding 1`. WedLinker includes the `Person` in the `Guest List`.

Step 4. If the user executes `assign-wedding 1 w/Test Wedding 1 p1/`, WedLinker will assign the `Person` as a partner instead.

Step 5. To view the Weddings in WedLinker, use `list-weddings`. This will switch the right panel to a Wedding view.

Step 6. The user executes `edit-wedding 1 w/Test Wedding 2 a/Fullerton Hotel`. `Test Wedding 1` will have its name edited to `Test Wedding 2` and its address be changed to `Fullerton Hotel`.
        If the right panel is still in the Wedding view, the changes will be reflected.

Step 7. The user executes `unassign-wedding 1 w/Test Wedding 2`. WedLinker would unassign the `Person` from `Test Wedding 2`.

Step 8. The user executes `delete-wedding w/Test Wedding 2`. WedLinker would delete `Test Wedding 2`.

<box type="info" seamless>
Wedding supports the force functionality for easier usage.

Force is supported for the following functions:
- `Assign Wedding` (Creates the Wedding if it does not already exist in WedLinker.)
- `Delete Wedding` (Unassigns all Person from the Wedding before it is deleted.)
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>
Known bugs:
- Wedding names with very long names overflow in the People view. No issues to functionality. 
  Longer Wedding names can be viewed as truncated in the Wedding view. Wedding view can be accessed using the list-weddings command.
</box>

### Vendors

The `Vendor` Feature allows users to track which `Person` are `Vendors` and assign `Tasks` to them. Only `Vendors` can be assigned `Tasks`.
Vendor would support the following functions:

* `Assign Vendor`â€‰â€”â€‰Assigns an existing `Person` in WedLinker to become a `Vendor`. 
* `Unassign Vendor`â€‰â€”â€‰Unassigns a `Vendor` to become a non-vendor `Person` contact. 

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how Vendors are used in WedLinker.

Step 1. The user launches the application, `Persons` and `Vendors` are loaded into the `Model`.

Step 2. The user executes `assign-vendor 1`. WedLinker will assign the `Person` at index 1 of the current displayed person list to become a `Vendor`. The user can now assign `Tasks` to this contact.

Step 3. The user executes `unassign-vendor 1`. The contact is no longer a `Vendor` and exists as a non-`Vendor` `Person` in WedLinker.

<box type="info" seamless>
Vendor supports the force functionality for easier usage.

Force is supported for the following functions:
- `Unassign Vendor` (Unassigns all existing `Task` from the Vendor before downgrading to a `Person`.)

</box>

### Task

The `Task` Feature allows users to track `Tasks` when planning for a Wedding. `Tasks` can only be assigned to `Vendors`.
There are different types of `Task` to support different requirements for the users.

`Task` type: `Todo`
`Todo` is the simplest kind of `Task` which has a description to provide information about the `Task`.

`Task` type: `Deadline`
`Deadline` is a type of `Task` which has a description to provide information and supports a due `Date`.

`Task` type: `Event`
`Event` is a type of `Task` which has a description to provide information and supports a start and end `Date`.

`Task` supports the following functions:
* `Create Task`â€‰â€”â€‰ Creates a new `Task` in WedLinker.
* `Assign Task`â€‰â€”â€‰ Assigns an existing `Task` to a `Vendor`. Tasks can only be assigned to `Vendors`.
* `Unassign Task`â€‰â€”â€‰ Unassigns a `Task` from a `Vendor`. 
* `Delete Task`â€‰â€”â€‰ Deletes a `Task` from WedLinker. 

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how Tasks are used in WedLinker.

Step 1. The user launches the application, `Tasks` are loaded into the `Model`.

Step 2. The user executes `create-task Order Wedding Cake`. WedLinker will create a new `Task` in the `Task List`.

Step 3. The user executes `assign-task 1 1` to assign the `Task` at index 1 of the `Task List` to the `Vendor` at index 1 on the `Person List`. 

Step 4. The user executes `unassign-task 1 1` to assign the `Task` at index 1 of the `Task List` from the `Vendor` at index 1 on the `Person List`.

Step 5. The user executes `unassign-task 1 1` to assign the `Task` at index 1 of the `Task List` from the `Vendor` at index 1 on the `Person List`.

Step 6. The user executes `delete-task 1 ` to delete the `Task` at index 1 of the `Task List` from the WedLinker.

### Switch Views
WedLinker features a split-view interface designed to display different lists side by side. The left side of the screen consistently shows the `Person List`, while the right side dynamically displays one of the following lists based on user input: `Wedding List`, `Task List`, or `Tag List`.
This functionality is managed through an enumeration that defines the available views: `WEDDING`, `TASK`, and `TAG`. The system switches between these views based on the user's actions, ensuring a flexible and intuitive user experience.

`View` supports the following functions: 
`List Weddings`â€‰â€”â€‰ displays a list of all weddings.
`List Tasks`â€‰â€”â€‰ displays a list of all tasks.
`List Tags`â€‰â€”â€‰ displays a list of all tags.

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how Tasks are used in WedLinker.

Step 1. The user launches the application, `Weddings`, `Tasks` and `Tags` are loaded into the `Model`.

Step 2. The user executes `list-weddings`. WedLinker display a list of all `Weddings` on the right half of the screen.

Step 3. The user executes `list-tasks`. WedLinker display a list of all `Tasks` on the right half of the screen.

Step 4. The user executes `list-tags`. WedLinker display a list of all `Tags` on the right half of the screen.


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Force Functionality:**

* **Alternative 1:** Users have to strictly follow the restrictions in running commands in WedLinker.
    * Pros: This is easier to implement and would be more stable
    * Cons: This might be restrictive and could slow down the usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Users have the ability to bypass some restrictions in a controlled manner.
    * Pros: This would improve the ease of use.
    * Cons: Additional code is required to ensure controlled execution.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: Professional Wedding Planners

* needs to manage a significant number of contacts
* needs to manage multiple weddings happening at differing times
* needs to manage contacts across multiple weddings
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Simplifies managing wedding-related contacts through text-based commands by providing a centralized wedding planning management system designed to efficiently 
handle the complexities of coordinating with multiple vendors, venues, and clients, while streamlining communication and event planning tasks.


### User stories

Priorities:
High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) -  `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`

Those without any stars are user stories that were considered but will not be implemented at this time.

| Priority | As a â€¦â€‹                   | I want to â€¦â€‹                                                                                                         | So thatâ€¦â€‹                                                                                                                                                           |

<br><br>

2. WedLinker has the following functions
   - find a person: `find`
   - add a person: `add`
   - delete a person: `delete`
   - list all persons: `list`
   - create a tag: `create-tag` or `ctag`
   - delete a tag: `delete-tag` or `dtag`
   - tag a person: `tag`
   - untag a person: `untag`
   - list all tags: `list-tags` or `ltags`
   - create a task: `create-task` or `ctask`
   - delete a task: `delete-task` or `dtask`
   - assign a task to a vendor: `assign-task` or `atask`
   - unassign a task from a vendor: `unassign-task` or `unatask`

<h3 class="features">General Features</h3>

### Saving data

1. Saving data altered during application use <br>

    1. WedLinker automatically saves data to the hard disk during operation. Any operations that change details of contacts,
    weddings, tags, or tasks will be saved immediately following the operations is successfully executed.


2. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

    1. Upon booting up WedLinker and the contact/wedding/tag/task list is not as per expected, open the `data` folder where WedLinker stores data.
   
    2. Within the folder, open `addressbook.json` and identify any mistakes with stored data.<br>
       The terminal from where `WedLinker.jar` is launched should log where the file is corrupted.

    3. If the data is beyond repair, delete the entire `data` folder or the `addressbook.json` file to start afresh with sample data.

## Appendix: Efforts

WedLinker is a project adapted from the original [AddressBook3 (AB3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/) customized specifically for wedding planners by our team of five.
Throughout this project, we split the work evenly and adhered to the principles and concepts that were taught by the
CS2103T teaching team, including:
- [Forking Workflow](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week7/topics.html#project-management-revision-control-forking-flow)
- [Feature Branch Flow](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week7/topics.html#project-management-revision-control-feature-branch-flow)
- [UML Class Diagrams](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/uml.html#class-diagrams)
- [Testing](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/se-book-adapted/chapters/testing.html)

As we envisioned an application for wedding planners, we concocted multiple features based on feedback from the wedding planners we interviewed.
These are the features that shape the WedLinker you see today.

#### Difficulty Level:
Adapting from the original AB3 to the WedLinker has been difficult as we opted for a more daring approach to implement 
many features that wedding planners wanted. As with any software, the more features implemented, the more bugs there are,
and WedLinker was no exception to it. 

As a result, the difficulty of developing WedLinker came not only from the
myriad of features we had to implement (and alter from the original AB3), but to also ensure that there were minimal bugs created.

#### Challenges Faced:
With the number of features that we wanted to implement, we had used the [Forking Workflow](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/website/schedule/week7/topics.html#project-management-revision-control-forking-flow)
that enabled us to work on numerous features, debugs, or minor adjustments concurrently. However, with the Forking Workflow came some drawbacks that we personally experienced, such as
the extra overhead of sending everything through forks, as well as the increased possibility of merge conflicts.

The numerous number of features also meant that our test coverage had to be extensive. This was a challenge as we had to
write new test codes for every single new feature implemented and perform regression testing with all previous features that might be potentially affected.

We also faced having to make design choices such as bidirectional navigability between `Person` and `Wedding`,
resulting in further design choices in storage of these data that relies on each other whilst maintaining validity checks.

#### Effort Required:
As we had chosen to implement numerous features and inevitably introduced bugs per iteration, the effort required to
resolve these issues were higher than if we had opted to be safe and tweak AB3 just a little.

#### Achievements:
As of 12 Nov 2024, WedLinker has:

- [Most LoC in AY2425 S1 CS2103T](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=totalCommits%20dsc&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=AY2425S1-CS2103T-F15-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2024-09-20)
- **20** new commands as compared to the original AB3

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

Team size: 5

Based on the current implementation of WedLinker, there are known bugs and limitations that we are unable to resolve due to the 
feature freeze. The plans to improve our features are as follows: 

1. **Resolve name overflow for Tags and Weddings**: Currently, there is a small GUI bug that occurs when the names of Tags and Weddings are excessively long, causing them to overflow, which causes cosmetic flaws.
The **planned enhancement** would be to truncate the name with an ellipses `...`, particularly by limiting the children of the list panels (e.g., the left pane that shows the list of People is a list panel) to adhere
to the width restrictions of the parent.

2. **Duplicate validation for Person, Wedding, Task and Tag entities**: Currently, there is a duplicate validation bug that allows the creation of certain "duplicate" Person, Wedding, Task and Tag objects.
For example, "John Doe" and "John  Doe" (the same name but with an extra space), are not recognised as duplicates in WedLinker although they are likely to refer to the same entity in the real world.
The **planned enhancement** would be to update the parser to normalise input by stripping all extra whitespace, leaving only a single space between keywords, before creating the respective command objects.
This will ensure that entries with excessive spaces are treated as duplicates where appropriate.

3. **Vendor validation when unassigning Tasks from Person**: Currently, there is a missing validation in `unassign-task` command that negates the check of whether a Person is a Vendor, resulting 
in an incorrect error message to be shown. When a user tries to execute the `unassign-task` command on a Person who is not a Vendor and thus cannot even have tasks assigned to it, 
the error message indicates that there are no tasks in the person's list, rather than indicating that the person is not a Vendor.
However, there is no functionality flaw and the application runs as intended.
The **planned enhancements** would be to add validation to ensure the target person is a Vendor and show a more indicative error
message.

4. **Make `unassign-wedding` case-insensitive**: The `unassign-wedding PERSON_INDEX w/WEDDING_NAME` command is case-sensitive for the `WEDDING_NAME`. This means that the command will only unassign a Wedding if the case of the `WEDDING_NAME` exactly matches case of the word as stored in WedLinker.
This limits the speed with which users can use the application, and does not 
align with the case sensitivity defined for Weddings in the `Wedding::isSameWedding(Wedding)` function, nor does it reflect real-world case-sensitivity of wedding names.
The **planned enhancement** would be to ensure that when unassigning weddings, case is ignored and the `Wedding::isSameWedding(Wedding)` function is used
to check for ensure proper matching of Wedding regardless of case.

5. **Make `untag` case-insensitive**: The `untag PERSON_INDEX t/TAG_NAME` command is case-sensitive for the `TAG_NAME`.
This means that the command will only untag a Tag if the case of the `TAG_NAME` exactly matches case of the word as stored in WedLinker.
This limits the speed with which users can use the application and does not
align with the case sensitivity defined for Tag in the `Tag::isSameTag(Tag)` function, nor does it reflect real-world case-sensitivity of tag names.
The **planned enhancement** would be to ensure that when untagging Person objects, case is ignored and the `Tag::isSameTag(Tag)` function is used
to check for ensure proper matching of Tag regardless of case.

6. **Allow searching contacts with blank fields**: Currently, the `find` command does not support searching for contacts with blank field values.
For example, using the command `find a/`, where the address field is empty, will display an error on the GUI telling the user that the field to be searched cannot be empty. 
However, contacts can currently be added with all fields, other from name, blank. Thus, there may be valid cases where users want to search for contacts with certain blank fields. 
The **planned enhancement** would be to modify the `find` command to allow users to search for contacts with blank fields.
When no keywords are provided after a prefix (e.g., `find a/`), the application should return a list of contacts where the corresponding field is blank.

7. **Allow processing of multiple partner tags for `assign-wedding`**: The `assign-wedding` command accepts the parameters `w/WEDDING_NAME [p1/] [p2/]`, where the partner tags
optionally assign the person being assigned as a partner for the wedding specified by `WEDDING_NAME`. Currently, if multiple partner tags are entered, regardless of their order,
the person is assigned as the first partner in the given wedding. However, users might want to be notified of a mistake they are making in assigning a partner for a wedding
if they accidentally include both tags, especially as this might overwrite an existing partner for the wedding.
The **planned enhancement** would be to add processing that checks for two partner tags and either considers the orders of the tag (and assigns the person as whichever partner tag is specified
first), or that signals an error to the user in the command they enter.

8. **Allow automatic update of User Interface upon changing data values**: For some commands, such as `unassign-wedding`, the User Interface will update
when it is clicked on to show the updated data but, sometimes, will not automatically update when the command is run.
The **planned enhancement** would be to either add more listeners for all commands in the UI components to ensure they are always updated when a command is entered
or to make sure each command modifies the underlying lists in a way that will cause the UI to automatically update.
