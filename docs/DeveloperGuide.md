## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram. The same goes for subsequent sequence diagrams in this guide.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command. 
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`. 
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve. 
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the application data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores two instances of currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query and a schedule query) as a _filtered_ patient list and a _filtered and sorted_ appointment list which are exposed to outsiders as two separate unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both application data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Patient Feature

#### Overview
The `add` command allows users to add new patients. The command requires:
- **Name** â€“ Patient's name.
- **ID** â€“ Patient's unique ID.
- **Ward** â€“ Patient's Ward.
- **Diagnosis** (Optional) â€“ Patient's Diagnosis.
- **Medication** (Optional) - Patient's Medication.

Here is an activity diagram that summarises the key steps taken.
<puml src="diagrams/AddActivityDiagram.puml" alt="AddActivityDiagram" />

#### 1. Parsing User Input
The **`AddCommandParser`** class is responsible for parsing user input. It uses `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting:
- **Name** â€“ Patient's name.
- **ID** â€“ Patient's unique ID.
- **Ward** â€“ Patient's Ward.
- **Diagnosis** â€“ Patient's Diagnosis.
- **Medication** - Patient's Medication.

The parser will check that the compulsory `Name`, `ID`, and `Ward` fields are present, and that there are no duplicate parameters included in the input string. The optional `Diagnosis` and `Medication` fields will be parsed as empty strings if they are not included in the input string.

During this parsing process:
- A `Person` instance is created to hold the relevant fields.

#### 2. Executing the Command
The **`AddCommand`** class performs the following when adding a patient:

1. **Update Existing Patient Record**:  
   The new `Person` instance will be added to the existing patient record in the `Model`.

#### 3. Exceptions and warnings

The **`AddCommand`** class enforces validation rules to ensure non-duplicates and potential incorrect input fields.

- **Ensuring non-duplicates**:
  Check that the new person added does not already exist in WardWatch, i.e. does not already exist a person with same `ID`.
<br><br>
- **Warnings**:
  The command will also check for the presence of *special characters* in the `Ward` and `ID` fields. An appropriate warning will be displayed if they are present.

### Add Notes Feature

#### Overview
The `addnotes` command allows users to add notes to a specific patient. The command requires:
- **Index** â€“ Patient's index in the displayed patient list.
- **Notes** - Patient notes that the user wishes to write for the specified patient.

Here is a sequence diagram which showcases the flow of the program as well as the key steps taken.
<puml src="diagrams/AddNotesSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddNotesSequenceDiagram" />

#### 1. Parsing User Input
The **`AddNotesCommandParser`** class is responsible for parsing user input. It uses `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting:
- **Index** â€“ Identifies the patient in the displayed patient list.
- **Notes** - Patient notes that the user wishes to write for the specified patient.

During this parsing process:
- A `Notes` instance is created to hold the note details.

#### 2. Executing the Command
The **`AddNotesCommand`** class performs the following steps to add `Notes` to a patient:

1. **Retrieve Patient Information**:  
   Uses the index from the parser to locate the patient in the latest filtered list of patients.

2. **Create New Person Instance with the Notes instance**:
   - Combines patient information with the new `Notes` details.
   - Creates a new updated `Person` instance, with the `Notes`.

3. **Replace Existing Patient Record**:
   The new `Person` instance, with the `Notes`, replaces the existing patient record in the `Model`.

4. **Updating filtered list**:
   The `Model` will then update the filtered list of patients to show all patients.

#### 3. Handling Invalid Date Inputs
The **`AddNotesCommandParser`** and **`AddNotesCommand`** classes enforce validation rules to ensure that valid index and notes are being passed in.

- **Valid index verification**:
  - **`AddNotesCommandParser`** checks if the index is an unsigned non-zero integer.
  - **`AddNotesCommand`** checks if the index is greater than the number of patients in the last displayed list.
  <br><br>
- **Valid notes verification**:
  - **`AddNotesCommandParser`** checks if the user input for notes is empty and throws an error message stating that the user is unable to add empty notes to a patient.

### Add Appointment Feature

#### Overview
The `makeappt` command allows users to add an appointment tied to a specific patient. The command requires:
- **Index** â€“ Patient's index in the address book.
- **Start Date** â€“ Beginning date and time of the appointment.
- **End Date** â€“ Ending date and time of the appointment.
- **Description** â€“ Brief description of the appointment.

<puml src="diagrams/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram" />

#### 1. Parsing User Input
The **`AddAppointmentCommandParser`** class is responsible for parsing user input. It uses `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting:
- **Index** â€“ Identifies the patient in the address book.
- **Start Date** â€“ Beginning of the appointment.
- **End Date** â€“ End of the appointment.
- **Description** â€“ Additional details about the appointment.

During this parsing process:
- An `Appointment` instance is created to hold the appointment details.

#### 2. Executing the Command
The **`AddAppointmentCommand`** class performs the following steps to add an appointment:

1. **Retrieve Patient Information**:  
   Uses the index from the parser to locate the patient in the latest filtered list of patients.

2. **Create New Person Instance with Appointment**:
    - Utilises patient information from the current patient (identified by the index) and the new `Appointment` details.
    - Creates an new `Person` instance with patient information and `Appointment` instance.

3. **Replace Existing Patient Record**:
   The new `Person` instance, containing the `Appointment`, replaces the existing patient record in the `Model`.

#### 3. Handling Invalid Date Inputs
The **`AddAppointmentCommandParser`** and **`AddAppointmentCommand`** classes enforce validation rules to ensure correct date formats and scheduling logic:

- **Format Verification**:
    - **`AddAppointmentCommandParser`** checks if the date and time format follows `dd-MM-yyyy-HH-mm`.
    - It also ensures the **Start Date** is before or equal to the **End Date**.
    - It also checks if date and time is valid.
      <br><br>

- **Conflict Checking**:
    - **`AddAppointmentCommand`** checks if the new appointment overlaps with any existing appointments for the patient.
    - If there is an overlap, an error message is thrown, preventing the appointment from being created.
    - If no overlap exists, the new appointment overrides any previous appointment.

### Schedule Date Feature

#### Overview
The `scheduledate` command allows users to filter the appointments occurring on a specified date. The command requires:
- **Date** â€“ Date regarding schedule of interest.

<puml src="diagrams/ScheduleDateSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ScheduleDateSequenceDiagram" />

#### 1. Parsing User Input
The **`ScheduleDateCommandParser`** class is responsible for parsing user input. It uses `ParserUtil` extracting:
- **Date** â€“ Date regarding schedule of interest.

During this parsing process:
- An `AppointmentContainsDatePredicate` instance is created to hold the date predicate details.

#### 2. Executing the Command
The **`ScheduleDateCommand`** class performs the following steps to filter the appointments:

1. **Update filteredAppointments**:  
   Uses the `AppointmentContainsDatePredicate` from the parser to update `filteredAppointments` in `Model`.

2. **Display sortedAppointments**:
   `sortedAppointments` will be updated with the updated `filteredAppointments` in `Model`.
   `sortedAppointments` is displayed.

#### 3. Handling Invalid Date Inputs
The **`ScheduleDateCommandParser`** class enforces validation rules to ensure correct date format and scheduling logic:

- **Format Verification**:
    - **`ScheduleDateCommandParser`** checks if the date format follows `dd-MM-yyyy`.
    - It also checks if the date is valid.

### Find Feature

#### Overview
The `find` command allows users to search through the entire patient list and filter it based on a given field and certain keywords. The command requires:
- **Field** - The specific field to perform the search on.
- **Keyword(s)** - The keyword(s) to search for.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FindSequenceDiagram" />

#### 1. Parsing User Input
The **`FindCommandParser`** class is responsible for parsing user input. It uses `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting:
- **Prefix** - the prefix associated with the field we wish to search through.
- **Search String** - A String containing the keyword(s) to search for.

During the parsing process:
- The Search String is split by white spaces, creating a list of Keyword(s).
- A `FieldContainsKeywordPredicate` instance is created to hold the field and Keyword(s) details.

#### 2. Executing the Command
The **`FindCommand`** class performs the following steps to filter the patient list:

1. **Update `filteredPersons`**:
    Uses the `FieldContainsKeywordPredicate` from the parser to update `filteredPersons` in `Model`.
    This will perform a search on the specified field for every patient, returning `true` if any word in the field contains any of the keyword(s) as a substring.

2. **Display `filteredPersons`**:
    The displayed list of patients will automatically update with the new filteredPersons as it is an `ObservableList`.

#### 3. Handling Invalid Inputs
The **`FindCommandParser`** class enforces validation rules to ensure that the input is valid:

- **Format Verification**:
  - **`FindCommandParser`** checks if there is one and only one field specified.
  - It also checks to ensure the search string is not empty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Planned Enhancements**

### `Last edited` functionality
Currently, there is no way to tell when a patient was last edited. This information might be crucial in a healthcare setting where the healthcare professional may need to know how recent the information is.<br><br>
**Planned implementation**<br><br>
We can make it such that a `Person` object contains a `LocalDateTime` field called `lastEdited` that keeps track of when the `Person` was last updated. This field will be updated whenever a new `Person` is created, be it from the `add` command or any of the other commands that edits a `Person`. The `lastEdited` field will be displayed in the result display screen.
<br><br>

### Make "Index does not exist" error message more specific
Currently, whenever a user enters a command that requires `INDEX` as a parameter, such as the `view` or `delete` command, and enters an index that is either non-positive or greater than `Integer.MAX_VALUE` of `2147483647`, WardWatch will show the general `invalid command format` message followed by the command usage message. <br><br>
**Planned implementation**<br><br>
We plan to make the current invalid index message more specific and add more error messages in the case where users pass in the following invalid indexes:
- The current invalid index message which is thrown when a valid index that is greater than the largest index in the displayed patient list just states that `The person index provided is invalid` and is not specific enough. We plan to change it to `The index provided does not refer to any patient in the displayed list, please check the displayed list again!` which will give users a better idea of what went wrong.
- In the case where the index passed in is greater than the `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, the error message `The index provided is greater than 2147483647 which is unfortunately not supported in our product, please try again with a smaller index!` will be shown.
- In the case where the index passed in is non-positive, the error message `INDEX provided must be a positive integer, please try again!` will be shown.
<br><br>

### Add appointment title and description and `viewappt` command
Currently, our `makeappt` command only allows users to create appointments with a short description. This prevents users from adding too much information to the current description which may be restrictive.<br><br>
**Planned implementation**<br><br>
We plan to separate appointment title and description which gives users more flexibility. Appointment title will just be a short description such as `Surgery` or `Medical checkup` and support a character limit of 40. Appointment description will be for additional information about the appointment that the user may want to add. The appointment description will support a much longer character limit of 300 but will not be shown in the appointment list panel as the long inputs may cause issues with the UI. <br>
As such we will also implement a `viewappt` command that allows users to view all information about the appointment including the new appointment description.
<br><br>

### Add command shortcut for longer commands
Currently, some of the commands in WardWatch such as `scheduleall` and `scheduledate` are very long and may be hard to type for users. <br><br>
**Planned implementation**<br><br>
We plan to add command shortcuts for longer commands such as `sAll` and `sDate` for the commands `scheduleall` and `scheduledate` respectively. These command shortcuts will work alongside the original commands, meaning that whether the user types in `sAll` or `scheduleall`, WardWatch will recognise both as the `scheduleall` command. <br>
This is so that seasoned and more advanced users have the option to optimise their workflow by utilising the command shortcuts while newer users still have the option of using the more intuitive sounding commands which reduces the learning curve.
<br><br>

### Fix `addnotes` command showing all patients
Currently, the successful execution of an `addnotes` command will subsequently reset the last filtered list of patients to show all patients again. Resetting the displayed list may make it difficult for the user to confirm his/her changes. <br><br>
**Planned implementation**<br><br>
We plan to change the implementation of `addnotes` command such that the patient list will remain filtered after the successful addition of notes.
<br><br>

### Make duplicate ID checking case-insensitive
Currently, the checking for duplicate patient ID when creating a new patient is case-sensitive, meaning that patients with similar IDs except for the casing of letters will be considered different. For example, the IDs `P12345` and `p12345` will be considered different. This may increase user errors when they are searching for a specific patient.<br><br>
**Planned implementation**<br><br>
We plan to make the duplicate ID cross-checking case-insensitive such that similar IDs that differ only by casing will be considered as duplicate. This will help to reduce the room for human error when using our product.
<br><br>

# Appendix: Efforts

This section presents an overview of the work invested by our team in developing WardWatch. We will discuss the complexity and scope, obstacles encountered, and effort required to bring this project to completion.

## Complexity and Scope
WardWatch expands on the Person entity originally found in AB3 by adding new entities, such as Appointment and Medication, to meet healthcare-specific demands. These additions introduced new requirements for feature interactions, data management, and storage, which proved more intricate than initially expected.

Beyond adapting AB3â€™s original features to better fit our target users, WardWatch introduces numerous commands to enhance the applicationâ€™s usability, particularly for managing patient information and healthcare operations. Integrating these features smoothly with existing functionality demanded considerable attention to detail.

While each of us contributed fewer lines of code than in individual assignments, the group project required substantial coordination and teamwork. This collaboration was essential to ensure cohesive integration and functionality across all new features.

## Effort Invested

### Improvements to Existing Features

**New Patient Data Fields**  
To meet the requirements of a healthcare management application, additional fieldsâ€”such as diagnosis, medications, notes, and appointments were incorporated to provide a more comprehensive patient profile.

**Enhanced Search Capabilities**  
Our team upgraded the find command from AB3 to offer greater flexibility, allowing searches by not only name but also fields like diagnosis and medications. The enhanced find feature also enables filtering by specific criteria, which involved a full redesign of the search logic and thorough testing.

**User Interface (UI) Enhancements**  
We revamped the interface to align with WardWatchâ€™s new features and a healthcare-oriented theme. Additionally, the UI logic was refined to enable future developers to make changes with ease.

### Newly Added Features

**Appointment Tracking**  
The appointment tracking features represent one of the most significant additions, necessitating major changes to existing structures and multiple new commands to manage appointment schedules. This feature was the most complex and required a substantial effort to coordinate data interactions across various entities. We also had to factor in creating the class `AppointmentContainsDatePredicate` that implements Predicate<Person> such that the list can actually be filtered.

**Appointments Scheduling**  
Appointments scheduling was another big change we made for our application. It required a thorough understanding of storage management and the Java libraries such as `LocalDateTime` and `ObservableList`, etc. 

**Notes**  
Our team introduced Notes management commands, such as `addnotes` and `delnotes`, which involved creating new classes to support the Notes field and commands. We also took additional steps to ensure compatibility with existing command functionality.

## Challenges Encountered

**Understanding the AB3 Codebase**  
One major hurdle was grasping the existing AB3 codebase, including the structure, class dependencies, and functionality. This required us to carefully analyze how existing features would interact with our additions, which took considerable time and planning.

**Data Interaction Between New and Existing Entities**  
Linking new entities like Appointment with the Person entity required a thoughtful approach. We needed to create a clear data structure to maintain relationships without introducing dependencies that could hinder usability.

**UI Space Constraints**  
Designing a user-friendly interface within limited screen space was a significant challenge. We needed to balance providing sufficient information with maintaining a streamlined layout. After several iterations, we finalized a design that offers essential data without cluttering the interface.

**Implementation of new fields**  
The addition of new fields such as diagnosis and medication functionalities were more intricate than anticipated. These features required careful planning to account for various scenarios, recognising the balance between restricting the user input to overstricting. Regular discussions helped to streamline our ideas tasks and address any arising issues efficiently.

**Implementation of Appointments**  
In particular, we faced difficulties when attempting to implement the schedule as an `ObservableList<Person>` as it not only had to be filtered, but also had to be sorted. Having to understand the API of `ObservableList` provided by JavaFX was challenging. We also had to factor in creating the class `AppointmentContainsDatePredicate` that implements `Predicate<Person>` such that the list can actually be filtered, which brought about additional complexity.

**Data Management Strategy**  
Deciding on a data management structure for appointments and medications presented additional challenges. We carefully considered how to balance the storage of patient data within main entities or across relevant contexts.

**Debugging and Testing**  
Testing and debugging were crucial for ensuring a stable and smooth experience for users. While unit testing was straightforward, identifying edge cases was challenging. Rigorous testing was essential to guarantee proper error handling and avoid application crashes due to unexpected inputs.

## Achievements
In conclusion, our team manged to design and implement features, addressed bugs, and managed potential integration issues. Although we faced initial difficulties with complex features like appointment and management, collaboration enabled us to overcome these obstacles, ultimately achieving our goals for WardWatch.
