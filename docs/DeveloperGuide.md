## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="650"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person). Certain types of commands (FileAccessCommand) can also communicate with the `Storage` when it is executed.<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object `Model` and `Storage`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores a history of undoable commands executed successfully by the user, which allows the user to undo commands.
* only depends on the Logic component due to the undo feature.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### Implementation

The `add` command extends `Command` and implements `Undoable`. The `add` command adds a contact based on the supplied parameters, of which
`NAME`, `PHONE`, and `EMAIL` are compulsory while `ADDRESS`, `ROOM_NUMBER`, and `TAG` are optional.
The `add` command is undoable.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `add` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `add n/John Doe p/+65 98765432 e/johnd@example.com r/01-1008 a/John street t/Floor 1`.

<box type="info" seamless>

 **Note:** An error message will be displayed if attempting to add a contact with duplicate `NAME`, `PHONE` or `EMAIL`.

</box>


Step 2. The `add` command adds a contact with the name John Doe, phone number +65 98765432, email johnd@example.com, room number #01-1008, address John street, tag "Floor 1" to the address book.

The following sequence diagram shows how an `add` command goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/AddSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** There are no destroy markers (X) for `AddCommand` as it is preserved in the `undo` command stack.

</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `add` command:

<puml src="diagrams/AddActivityDiagram.puml" height="900" width="1000" />

### Edit feature

#### Implementation

The `edit` command extends `Command` and implements `Undoable`. The `edit` command updates an existing contact based on the supplied index and parameters, of which
only the `INDEX` supplied, as well as any one field to update is compulsory.
The `edit` command is undoable.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `edit` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `edit 1 n/John Doe p/+65 98765432`. 

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An error message will be displayed if attempting to edit a contact to have with duplicate `NAME`, `PHONE` or `EMAIL`.

</box>

Step 2. The `edit` command updates the details of the contact with index 1 to have the name John Doe and phone number +65 98765432.

The following sequence diagram shows how an `edit` command goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** There are no destroy markers (X) for `EditCommand` as it is preserved in the `undo` command stack.
 
</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `edit` command:

<puml src="diagrams/EditActivityDiagram.puml" height="900" width="1000" />

### Delete Command

#### Implementation

The `delete` command extends `Command` and implements `Undoable`. The `delete` command deletes a contact based on its index. The `delete` command is undoable.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `delete` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user input a delete command followed by an index. For example: `delete 1` deletes the contact with an index of 1.

Step 2. The parser parses the input command and returns a `DeleteCommand`.

Step 3. The `DeleteCommand` is executed by the LogicManager and delete popup get displayed.

Step 4. If user click `Ok` on the pop-up, model updates the filteredPersonList and removes the contact, otherwise cancel the deletion.

The following sequence diagram shows how a `delete` command goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command"/>

The following activity diagram summarizes the delete pop-up mechanism:

<puml src="diagrams/DeletePopupActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Popup interactions inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command"  height="500" width="800"/>


### Clean feature

#### Implementation

The `clean` command extends `Command` and implements `Undoable`. The `clean` command deletes the contacts whose `GradYear` field is earlier than the current year, deleting contacts who have graduated from the address book. The `clean` command is undoable.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `clean` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `clean` in 2024.

<box type="info" seamless>

 **Note:** The `clean` command checks if there are contacts with `GradYear` 2023 or earlier. If there are none, it will return an error message to the user.

</box>

Step 2. The `clean` command deletes all contacts with `GradYear` 2023 or earlier.


The following sequence diagram shows how a `clean` command goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/CleanSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="CleanSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** There are no destroy markers (X) for `CleanCommand` and `GradYearPredicate` as they are preserved in the `undo` command stack.

</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `clean` command:


<puml src="diagrams/CleanActivityDiagram.puml" height="500" width="800" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: UI display when `clean` executes after a `find` command:**

* **Alternative 1:** Display all contacts.
    * Pros: Shows users the full result of `clean`.
    * Cons: Forgets the results of the `find` command.

* **Alternative 2 (current implementation):** Retain the search results of `find` and only display those contacts.
    * Pros: Allow users to retain their serach results from `find`.
    * Cons: Users cannot see the full extent of `clean` until they return to the default view with `list`.

### Find Command

#### Implementation

The `find` command extends `Command` and implements `Undoable`. The `find` command searches and filters the contacts based on the following parameters: `NAME`, `PHONE`, `ROOM_NUMBER`, and `TAG`.The find command is undoable.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `find` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user issues a `find` command followed by specific parameters.
For example: `t/friends n/Alex r/08-0805 p/9124 6892`, searches for a profile with a 
tag of friends, a name called Alex, a room number of 08-0805, and a phone number of 9124 6842.

<box type="info" seamless>

 **Note** : These parameters can be combined in any sequence, allowing for versatile parameter configurations. 

</box>

Step 3. The `FindCommand` get executed and updates the filteredPersonList within the model, reflecting the search.

results based on the specified criteria.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="FindSequenceDiagram" height="900" width="1000"/>

### Export feature

#### Implementation

The `export` command extends `FileAccessCommand` and by extension, `Command`. The `export` command exports the contacts in DorManagerPro to a JSON file in the data folder of the app. 

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `export` command behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user executes the `export` command.

Step 2: The `export` command exports all data currently contained by DorManagerPro to a JSON file in the data folder of the application.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The name of the JSON file is the time of export in the format MM-dd-yyyy-HHmmssPM.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an `export` command goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/ExportSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ExportSequenceDiagram" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `export` command:

<puml src="diagrams/ExportActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ExportActivityDiagram" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect**: The name of the JSON file on `export`.

* **Alternative 1:** Use a generic format such as `SAVE_FILE_1`, `SAVE_FILE_2`.
    * Pros: Easy for the user to know at first glance which save file was created latest as well as the chronological order of their creation.
    * Cons: Does not tell the user at what time they actually exported the save file or contents of the save file.

* **Alternative 2 (current implementation):** The time of the device's system at the moment of `export`.
    * Pros: Allows for pinpoint of exact save files as no two files can be exported at the same time.
    * Cons: Takes longer to manually understand the name of the save file when trying to locate a specific one, especially when multiple `exports` happen within a short peri            od of time. Also has no mention of contents of JSON file.

* **Alternative 3:** A brief summary of the file such as `FIRST-Alex_Jones LENGTH-20`.
    * Pros: Easy for the user to know at first glance what the contents of each file are.
    * Cons: Does not tell the user at what time they actually exported the save file. Also has no indication of the chronology of creation of the files, and hence no information on which file was the last to be created. Additionally, it would become complicated when exporting files with similar data.

### Import feature

#### Implementation

The `import` command extends `FileAccessCommand` and by extension, `Command`. It also implements `Undoable`. `import` loads data from a save file into DorManagerPro, with the file path of the save file provided by the user. The `import` command is undoable.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `import` command behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `import fp/./data/SaveFile3.json`

Step 2. The `import` command locates the save file via the file path and reads the data in the save file into DorManagerPro if it is of the correct format and has valid data.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An error message is raised if the file path does not exist in the device or if the file itself cannot be read into DorManagerPro.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an `import fp/./data/SaveFile3.json` command goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/ImportSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ImportSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** There is no destroy marker (X) for `ImportCommand` as it is preserved in the `undo` command stack. <br>
The lifeline for `ImportCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `import` command:

<puml src="diagrams/ImportActivityDiagram.puml" alt="ImportActivityDiagram" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: The exact format of the `FILE_PATH` parameter**

* **Alternative 1:** Take in only the name of the JSON file in the data folder of the home folder.
    * Pros: Shorter command for the user to type. It is also considerably less complicated than alternative 2, making it more accessible to non-technical users.
    * Cons: Limits the ability of import to only the contents of the data folder. Also requires user to move any JSON file they may want to `import` into the data folder.

* **Alternative 2 (current implementation):** Require the user to type in the full file path of the JSON file they wish to `import`.
    * Pros: Allow greater flexibility for user to import JSON files from any location of the device.
    * Cons: Significantly longer command for the user to type. Requires user to have prior knowledge of what the JSON's filepath is, increasing complexity.

### Undo feature

#### Implementation

The undo mechanism is facilitated by the interface `Undoable`.
It has the `undo()` method. The `undo()` method is called when the user executes the `undo` command.
The `undo()` method reverses the effects of the command that was previously executed.
The `undo()` method is implemented in the undoable command classes, such as `AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, `EditCommand`, etc.

The `Model` component stores a history of executed undoable commands in a stack.
When a command is executed successfully, the command is pushed onto the stack.
When the user executes the `undo` command, the `Model` component pops the last command from the stack and calls the `undo()` method of the command.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#pushToUndoStack()` and `Model#undoAddressBook()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The undo stack is initialised as empty.

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command is pushed onto the undo stack.

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command is also pushed onto the undo stack.

<box type="info" seamless>
 
**Note:** If a command is not undoable or fails its execution, it will not be pushed onto the undo stack.
Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will pop the last command from the undo stack and call its `undo()` method. The `undo()` method of the command will then reverse the effects of the command.
<br>

**Note:** If the undo stack is empty, then there are no commands to undo. The `undo` command checks if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user.
</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:
<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will not be pushed to the undo stack. Thus, the undo stack remains unchanged.

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which is pushed to the undo stack.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" height="400" width="400"/>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 (current implementation):** Individual command knows how to undo by itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

3. Attempting to delete all graduated students when there are none.
   1. Prerequisites: No persons present in the address book with GRADUATION_YEAR field earlier than the current year.
   2. Test case: `clean`, executed in YEAR, where YEAR is the current year. <br>
      Expected: An error message displayed informing the user that there are no graduated students to be deleted.


## **Appendix: Planned enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Add more precise functionality to the `clean` command**. The `clean` command currently does not allow removal of students who have graduated in the current year, as it can only detect the graduation year but not the month. We plan to add support for storing a more specific graduation date, such that we can accurately remove students who have graduated immediately after their graduation.

2. **Add support for setting EmergencyName, EmergencyPhone and GraduationYear using the `add` command.**
The `add` command currently does not allow setting emergency contact details and graduation year of students.
The only way to set these fields is through the `edit` command, which can be inconvenient for users.
We plan to add support for setting EmergencyName, EmergencyPhone and GraduationYear to the `add` command.

3. **Add more features to the help command pop up window.** The `help` command pop up window currently only shows instructions for three commands, `add`, `edit` and `delete`. We plan
to add instructions for all other features to make it easier to familiarise themselves with the commands without going to the external User Guide.

4. **Add support to file path formatting in `import`.** Currently, the FILE_PATH parameter for the `import` command only takes in forward slashes, `/`, when taking in user input, e.g. `import fp/./data/SaveFile.json` would be a valid file path for `import`, but `import fp/.\data\SaveFile.json` would not be valid. We plan to add support to `\` as a delimiter between folders and files in the future to be more intuitive for users of all Operating Systems, especially those that use backslashes in file paths like Windows.

5. **Improve specificity of `import` error messages.** Currently, the error message for when the file exists on the device but is otherwise incompatible with DorManagerPro, whether this be because it is of the wrong file type, has a format incompatible with DorManagerPro or contains invalid data is as follows: <br>
Could not read data from file FILE_PATH due to inability to find or access the file. <br>
This error message could be more specific and our team plans to update this to the following error message: <br>
DorManagerPro could not access the file at FILE_PATH. This could be because the file is of the wrong type, it has a format incompatible with DorManagerPro or it contains invalid data. Please check that the file path leads to a JSON file with valid data and formatting.

6. **Consistent behavior for `find`.** Currently, `find` has some inconsistent behaviour depending on the field that it is being searched by, making it counterintuitive for users. The problems are as following: <br>
The name search is case-insensitive, but tag search is not. We plan to modify `find t/` tag search to make it case-insensitive. <br>
Searching by name filters contacts that match at least one keyword (i.e. `OR` search). E.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`. However, searching by phone number only filters contacts that match exactly to the optional country code, optional area code, and compulsory number. E.g. `98765432` will not return `+65 98765432`.<br>
We plan to modify `find p/` to allow searching by country code or area code only, and compulsory number only, so as to make this more versatile for users. <br>

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Overview

As we have adapted AB3 for university dorm managers, our main efforts were in adding support for other necessary fields, enhancing the duplicate handling and data validation, and providing extra functions to streamline data saving, adding, updating and to safeguard against mistakes.
This posed substantial difficulties for us, as we had to work within the AB3 model and implement the multiple features to be compatible with the rest of the app.
Thus, the was of considerable effort.

Here are some of the achievements of DorManagerPro:
* Fields
  * Added fields for room number, emergency contacts, and graduation year.
  * Implemented relevant duplicate handling and field constraints for room number, emergency contacts, and graduation years.
  * More specific and relevant field constraints and duplication handling for name, phone number, email address and tags.
* Features
  * All commands that change the state of the address book are now undoable!
  * It is now possible to export the state of the address book to a json file.
  * It is now possible to import a json file into the address book.
  * It is now possible to delete all students who have graduated at once in one command.

### Challenges faced

#### Challenge 1: Implementing undo functionality for import command

The undo functionality was initially implemented by extending an abstract class `ConcreteCommand` with the `undo` abstract method.
However, the import command is an undoable command that also extends the `FileAccessCommand` class.
This posed a challenge as the import command could not extend two classes at once because Java does not allow multiple inheritance.
To overcome this, we had to refactor the `ConcreteCommand` class to an interface `Undoable` and let all undoable commands implement this interface.
This allowed us to implement the `undo` method in the import command.

#### Challenge 2: Creating a dependency between Storage and FileAccessCommand for export and import

Import and export was initially deemed odd to do since it would have to access `Storage`, whereas all other commands at the time only needed to have access to `Model` to be executed. Accordingly, we were fairly certain that it would have been inadequate for the `import` and `export` commands to inherit directly from `Command`.
The workaround our team decided on was to create a new class `FileAccessCommand` that would require a `Model` and `Storage` for it's execute which `export` and `import` could then inherit from. As `FileAccessCommand` inherits from `Command` this allowed `export` and `import` to continue using the polymorphism when parsing commands and in the LogicManager while having a unique execute to carry out its functions.

#### Challenge 3: Removal of address field as a compulsory field

While AddressBook3 initially had address as a compulsory field when adding a person to the contact list, our team felt that in the context of DorManagerPro, addresses could instead be optional. In most cases, all the residents would by default live in the dorm managed by the user, and by extension have a common address.
We then had to contemplate between the outright removal of the field or only making it optional. We decided to make it optional as it could still provide helpful information such as the students permanent residence outside the dorm in case the user had to contact them.
Regardless, it was still quite a challenge to make the once compulsory field optional since it was so intertwined with the original AddressBook3.
