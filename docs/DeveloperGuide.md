### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g., `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data, i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g., the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The find command allows the user to filter the list of contacts by (at least one) criteria applied to data field(s) (`Name`, `Email`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Detail` and/or `StudyGroupTags`). Each field correspond to one criterion, and can consist of one or more keywords. The list of persons in the `AddressBook` is filtered, then displayed to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `n/Alice Bob` is a single criteria, while `n/Alice e/@example.com` is two criteria.

</div>

The user executes a find command with some inputs, for e.g., `find n/Alex Bernice t/1A`, which goes through the `Logic` component as shown by the following sequence diagram:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

For each criterion, a `Predicate` is initialised in the `Model` component as shown below:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram-PredicateModel.png)

The `PredicateGroup` consist of one or more `Predicate`. The following sequence diagram shows how a `PredicateGroup` is used to test a `Person` record:

![PredicateGroupSequenceDiagram](images/PredicateGroupSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Handling multiple criteria**<br>
Criteria are segregated by data field, and each criterion is independently evaluated.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**  For a person to be included, they must _satisfy all criteria_.
  * Pros: Allow the find command to filter very specific criteria that must all be fulfilled, enabling more accurate results.
  * Cons: May return fewer results, especially when using multiple criteria.

* **Alternative 2:** For a person to be included, they only need to _satisfy one criterion_.
  * Pros: Returns wider range of results, potentially finding more relevant person records.
  * Cons: Less specific when finding for exact match.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Researchers who,
* have a need to manage a significant number of study participants
* need an easy way to contact different experimental groups
* need quick access to study participants' information
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using *CLI* apps

**Value proposition**:

As researchers have to handle large groups of participants across multiple studies, `ResearchRoster` allows them to
* have all participants consolidated in a single program
* consolidate a list of contact details based on **specific experimental criteria**
* export it to an easy-to-read format for better data organization

Thus, *ResearchRoster* allows researchers to save time, effort and energy whilst keeping their participant data well-organised.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### General requirements

* The software should be offered as a free product/service.
* The source code should be open source.

#### Constraints

* The data should be stored locally in a human-editable text file (allowing advanced users to modify data directly).
* The software should have minimal reliance on network connectivity and include fallback mechanisms for any network-dependent features.
* The software should not depend on the developerâ€™s remote server.
* The software should be distributed as a single `.jar` file. If that is not feasible, the `.jar` file and any required files should be packaged into a single `.zip` file.
* The software should not exceed 100 MB in size, and document files (i.e., `PDF`s of documentation) should not exceed 15 MB each. Neither should be unnecessarily bloated.
* Any third-party frameworks, libraries or services used should be free, open-source (except for services) and permissively licensed. They should not require users to install additional software or create accounts.
* The developer and user guides should be `PDF`-friendly (by avoiding expandable panels, embedded videos, animated `GIF`s etc.).

#### Quality

* The software should be optimized for the target users: fast typists should be able to complete most tasks more efficiently using the _CLI_ than a _GUI_.
* The software should be intuitive and easy for first-time users to navigate (by providing sample data, a `help` command to access the user guide etc.).
* Multistep commands for onboarding (if any) should have a streamlined, one-step equivalent for regular or expert users.
* The _GUI_ should be intuitive for users who are not tech-savvy.

#### Performance and Efficiency

* The software should respond to user actions within 5 seconds.

#### Scalability

* The software should be able to accommodate up to 5,000 contacts, without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.

#### Reliability

* The software should maintain stable operation (i.e., function as intended) at least 99.9% of the time.

#### Robustness

* **Disaster Recovery and Fault Tolerance:** The software should gracefully handle exceptional events (e.g., errors or failures) without losing data or compromising functionality (e.g., crashing).
* **Error Handling:** Clear, informative error messages should be provided, and errors logged to aid troubleshooting and support.

#### Compliance

* The software should protect research participants' confidentiality and comply with relevant legal standards (by safeguarding _private contact details_).

#### Portability

* The software should work without requiring an installer.
* The software should run on any _mainstream OS_ that has `Java 17` (and no other Java version installed).
* The _GUI_ should be free from resolution-related inconveniences for standard screen resolutions (1920x1080 or higher) and screen scales (100% and 125%).
* The _GUI_ should remain functional, though not necessarily optimized, for resolutions of 1280x720 or higher and screen scales of 150%.

#### Maintainability

* **Code Quality:** The code should be well-maintained and follow best practices.
* **Documentation:** Clear, consistent and accurate documentation is required.
* **Testability:** Implemented features should not impede testing or make the software difficult to test.

#### Process Requirements

* The project should follow a development schedule that delivers incremental versions on a weekly basis.

#### Notes about project scope

* Input should primarily be via the _CLI_, with the _GUI_ mainly providing visual feedback.
* The software does not need to support the printing of reports or contacting research participants.
* The software is intended for single-user operation, not multi-user functionality.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **UI**: User Interface - The medium through which users interact with a system, encompassing both graphical (*GUI*) and text-based (*CLI*) elements
* **GUI**: Graphical User Interface - A visual-based interface where users interact with the system through graphical elements like icons and windows
* **CLI**: Command Line Interface - A text-based interface where users interact with the system by typing commands

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Make opening url from `help` window work on WSL2**: There are reported cases where clicking the User Guide link from the help window is not working (failing silently) on WSL2. While we are unable to reproduce the bug at the moment, we plan to look into and fix it, allowing it to either work as intended or fail more gracefully.
2. **Relax constraints on name field**: The current constraint on Names only allows alphabet characters and spaces, and requires 2 words (first and last name). We plan to loosen these constraints to allow for some special characters like `/` in `s/o`, as well as numeric characters for names like `Alexander the 3rd`.
3. **Relax constraints on study group tag field**: The current constraint on Study Group Tags only allows alphanumeric characters and dashes. We plan to loosen these constraints to allow for more special characters to increase the expressiveness of the study group tags.
4. **Resolve conflicting tag operations (adding and removing) in `edit` command**: When editing a person's record, the user can choose to add and remove the same tag (in any order) and the result would be no change made with respect to the tag, as well as an incorrect error message. We plan to take the order of adding/removing tags into consideration when applying changes to a person, and output an error message when duplicate tags (for adding and removing) are detected in the inputs.
5. **Enforce non-empty tag arguments in `edit` command**: When editing a person's record, the user can choose to input no arguments behind tag prefixes, for e.g., `edit 1 t/` or `edit 1 -t/`, and the command will run and succeed without making any changes. We plan to return an error message, disallowing empty arguments for tag prefixes.
6. **Disallowing consecutive spaces in names**: When adding and editing names, the user can add a name with consecutive spaces within, for e.g. `John   Doe`, which will fail without pointing out the disallowed consecutive spaces. We plan to make the error message point out the reason for failure: `The name contains consecutive spaces, which is not allowed.`
7. **Include more information in help command**: The `help` command currently opens a window with a link to the User Guide. We plan to include a command summary in the output message of the `help` command as a quick reference guide.
8. **Improve cancellation signal for `clear` process**: The `clear` process can be cancelled by typing anything (including non-command words). The current message for non-command word cancellation is to show an `unknown command` error, but silently succeed in cancelling the `clear` process. We plan to add a message to inform the user the `clear` process is successfully cancelled.
9. **Designate specific word for cancelling clear process**: We plan to designate a specific word (e.g., cancel) to cancel clearing. This is to reduce potential confusion a user may have during the clearing process.
10. **Improve error messages for failed exports due to non-existent filepath**: The current `unexpected I/O error` message for a non-existent filepath is too general. We plan to make the error message also mention the reason the export failed.

## **Appendix: Effort**

* As we were building off of AB3, we were able to reuse the model package and the existing commands.
* In the beginning of our project (v1.2), this saved us time and effort as it was easy to build an MVP from an already functioning product (AB3) by making basic modifications to suit our product.
* We were also able to reuse the extensive test cases and utility in the `testutil` package, which saved us a lot of effort. Future test cases and utility were also designed after these existing ones.
* However, challenges arose when we wanted to refine our MVP features to better suit ResearchRoster (v1.3) and add new features unlike what AB3 had (v1.3, v1.4, v1.5).
* This was because we had to carefully look through the AB3 code to fully understand how it worked, in order to figure out how we can modify it, work with it, or work around it to implement changes and new features.
* This resulted in us putting in a high amount of effort to maintain good OOP and use/build off the existing classes and methods in AB3, rather than simply creating new classes, methods and solutions that may have overlapped with existing classes and methods.
* The high effort was also because some of the existing classes methods posed limitations to what we wanted to implement, and we had to come up with workarounds to achieve our desired modifications.
* For example, `Edit` command class and `EditPersonDescriptor` class needed lots of reworking because the initial functionality only allowed to overwrite list of tags whilst our product aimed to append to the list and delete from the list instead of resetting the whole list.
* Achievements: We were able to achieve a product that is provides useful and efficient features for researchers. We were able to create new, unique commands such as the `export` and `assign` commands, providing researchers with specialized features of exporting participants' emails, and randomly assigning participants to a different study groups, respectively. Thus, we believe we have achieved our aims of creating a product designed specifically for researchers, which sets ResearchRoster apart from other contact storing applications.
