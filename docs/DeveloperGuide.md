### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object and `Group` object residing in the
  `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="488" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores the currently 'selected' `Group` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Group>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.

- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Group feature

The `GroupCommand` allows educators to group students together within the application. This is particularly useful for managing classes, group-based activities, assignments, and projects efficiently.

#### Implementation Details

The `GroupCommand` is implemented by extending the base `Command` class. It uses prefixes such as `/g`, `/s`, specifying
required data fields `groupName`, `students`, respectively. Once the data fields are filled,
a new Group is added. It implements the following operations:

* `execute(Model)` — Checks the current address book state by calling the following methods as part of our defensive programming:
  1. `model.hasGroupName(new Group(groupName, List.of()))`, and throws a `CommandException` if a duplicate Group is found
  2. `groupName.isEmpty()`, and throws a `CommandException` if a the group name field is empty is found
  3. `model.getFilteredPersonList()`, to obtain a `List<Person>` to iterate over to search for the inputted student names and adding them to a new `List<Person>` to be passed into the constrcutor for a new `Group`
* `addGroup(group)` — Adds the Group to the group list. This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addGroup(Group)`.

The Group command is initiated by firstly checking the filtered group list to ensure no duplicate is found, after which `Model#addGroup(Group)` is called to complete the actual addition.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the addition mechanism behaves when the user tries to add a group to the group list.

Step 1. The user launches the application, with some students and groups added to the address book already.
The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the previously saved address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `group` command with the specific data at each prefix to specify the person to be added.
The `GroupCommand` will then call `excecute()`, which checks whether there is a duplicate Group in the group list before calling `addGroup(Group)`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the `groupName` and `students` provided is invalid, a `CommandException` will be thrown.

</div>

#### Sequence Diagram

<img src="images/GroupSequenceDiagram.png" width="1080" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How Group executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create a new `Group` Object containing a list of `Person`, and storing it in the `model` component.

  - Pros: Easier to implement and more intuitive.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage, and deleting a student will require iterating over all `Group`s to ensure it is deleted from all groups

- **Alternative 2:** Each `Person` Object has a field of a List of all the groups it is in.
  - Pros: Deleting a person is alot easier (Simply by deleting the `Person` Object will remove it from all the `Group`s it is in)).
  - Cons: Very hard to implement, and not a good representation of the has-a relationship between `Group` and `Person`.

### Delete Group feature

The `DeleteGroupCommand` allows educators to delete Groups within the application. This is particularly useful 
for deleting Groups that the user no longer need, assisting the management of Groups.

#### Implementation Details

The `DeleteGroupCommand` is implemented by extending the base `Command` class. It does not use any prefixes, rather
using the `groupName` to identify which group to delete. Once the data fields are filled, it will look for the specified group containing that `groupName` and delete it.
It implements the following operations:

* `execute(Model)` — Checks the current address book state by calling the `model.getFilteredGroupList()` to obtain an `ObservableList<Group>` and iterating over it to find a matching `groupName`, throwing a `CommandException` if 
  no `Group` is found.
* `deleteGroup(groupToDelete)` — Deletes the Group from the group list. This operation is exposed in the `Model` 
  interface as `Model#deleteGroup(Group)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the delete group mechanism behaves when the user tries to delete a group from the group list.

Step 1. The user launches the application, with some students and groups added to the address book already. The 
`AddressBook` will be initialized with the previously saved address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `deleteGroup` command with the specified Group Name to specify the `Group` to be added.
The `deleteGroupCommand` will then call `excecute()`, which checks whether there is a Group in the group list that 
matches the name before calling `deleteGroup(Group)`.

#### Sequence Diagram

<img src="images/DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram.png" width="1080" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How deleteGroup executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Iterating over all `Group` in model and searching for a match and proceeding to delete that group

    - Pros: Easier to implement, and deleting a Group will not cause bugs in other logic components
    - Cons: Can become very slow when there are many groups in `Logic`

- **Alternative 2:** Using a Hash to map every groupName to its respective Group
    - Pros: Deleting a Group is much faster, since there is no longer a need to iterate over all groups within model
    - Cons: The logic will be much more complicated, and showing a Hash through JavaFx is much more difficult compared to using the already provided `ObservableList`

### Export feature

The `ExportCommand` allows educators to export the data in their current GoonBook storage out as a csv file for usage in other spreadsheets such as Google spreadsheets, giving GoonBook seamless integration with existing spreadsheet editors.

#### Implementation Details

The `ExportCommand` is implemented by extending the base `Command` class. It does not use any prefixes, and is called as is. Once the data fields, like `projectRootPath` are filled, it will proceed to convert the data in model into a json file, then into a csv file for the user to freely use. It implements the following operations:

* `execute(Model)` —  Obtain the `Path` Objects that represent both the import directory, and the export directory, by calling the `Path#resolve` method.
* `saveJsonfile` —  Takes in the `model`, `importPath` and `exportPath` as parameters to then convert the data in model to a csv file by further calling the methods `translateJsonToCsv` and `getPersonTags` which will perform the necessary actions to convert the json file into a csv file

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the export mechanism behaves when the user tries to export data
from GoonBook.

Step 1. The user launches the application, with some students and groups added to the address book already. The 
`AddressBook` will be initialized with the previously saved address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `export` command. The `ExportCommand` will then call `excecute()`, which proceeds to take the current data stored in the address book and converting it into a csv file, and saving it in the same directory as root for the user to access

#### Sequence Diagram

<img src="images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png" width="1080" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How export executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using the existing Storage interface and addressBook.json to directly convert into a csv file

    - Pros: Has already laid the foundation for our csv conversion method to build off from
    - Cons: Has an added dependency on the json file, so if any issues were to occur to the json coverter, it would mean that the export function would no longer function

- **Alternative 2:** Directly exporting the data of the address book and converting it into a csv file without needing the dependency on the json file
    - Pros: Will ensure that any bugs with the jsonAdaptablePersons and etc will not affect the functionality of the export function, since they would no longer be associated
    - Cons: Extremely hard to implement, and would not be worth the hassle

### Tag feature

The `TagCommand` allows educators to add custom tags to their students for quality of life benefits, such as reminders, or to categorise them accordingly.

#### Implementation Details

The `TagCommand` is implemented by extending the base `Command` class. It uses only the prefix `/t` taking in a index as the other part of the command syntax, specifying required data fields `newTags` and `targetIndex`, respectively. Once the data fields are filled, new tags are added to a specified Person. It implements the following operations:

* `execute(Model)` — Obtain a `List<Person>` using the `model.getFilteredPersonList`, and using the `targetIndex` to get the corresponding `Person` object to add the `newTags` to, by calling `model.addTag`
* `targetIndex.getZeroBased` — Used to check if the given index is larger than the size of the filteredPersonList, and throws a `CommandException` if the index is larger than the index in filteredPersonList
* `model.tagExists(person, newTags)` — Used to check if the person object already has the given tag name already, 
  throws a `CommandException` if the person is found to already have an existing tag of the same name

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the tag mechanism behaves when the user tries to add a tag to a student

Step 1. The user launches the application, with some students and groups added to the address book already.
The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the previously saved address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `tag` command. The `TagCommand` will then call `excecute()`, which proceeds to take 
the list of filtered person, and using the index provided by the user, choose that specific person to add the given 
`tags` to

#### Sequence Diagram

<img src="images/TagSequenceDiagram.png" width="1080" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How tag executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using a Set to implement a collection of tags per student

    - Pros: Can easily check to see if there are any duplicate tags due to the nature of the data structure, saving 
      time that would have otherwise been spent iterating through it
    - Cons: If we ever decided to allow multiple tags with the same name, we will not be able to do so
  
- **Alternative 2:** Using a List to implement a collection of Tags
- 
    - Pros: Much simpler to implement, and familiar to use
    - Cons: Can become very inefficient, when there are many tags, it could take some time to iterate through every
      tag one by one to ensure that the same tag doesn't exist twice


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

- `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`— Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`— Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`— Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()`
and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also
calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into
the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once
to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`.
Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

This section outlines future enhancements planned for the application.

---

### **Enhancement 1: Export Specific Groups to CSV Files**

**Current Issue:**  
The `export` command exports all GoonBook data without filtering options, lacking the ability to export specific groups.

**Proposed Enhancement:**  
Allow users to export selected groups to CSV files, providing a choice based on user preference.

**Justification:**  
Selective export enhances data portability, enabling users to share or back up specific groups as needed.

**Updated Behavior:**  
- Introduce an `exportGroup` command for exporting chosen groups to a CSV file.

---

### **Enhancement 2: Custom Export Filename and File Path**

**Current Issue:**  
The `export` command defaults to exporting data to the root path with an unchangeable filename, `exported_data.csv`.

**Proposed Enhancement:**  
Allow users to specify a custom filename and file path when exporting data.

**Justification:**  
Flexible file naming and location options improve user experience, allowing organization based on user preferences.

**Updated Behavior:**  
- Modify the `export` command to accept optional filename and file path parameters.

---

### **Enhancement 3: Import Groups from CSV Files**

**Current Issue:**  
The `import` command imports all data from a CSV file indiscriminately, with no way to distinguish group data.

**Proposed Enhancement:**  
Add an `importGroup` command that creates groups based on CSV data, adding new students as needed or using existing ones.

**Justification:**  
This simplifies data entry and supports easy migration of group data into the application.

**Updated Behavior:**  
- Implement an `importGroup` command to import groups and members from CSV files.
- Automatically add new students to the database when importing.

---

### **Enhancement 4: Improved Handling of Duplicate Student Names**

**Current Issue:**  
The `addCommand` does not allow students with duplicate names, although real-life duplicates may exist.

**Proposed Enhancement:**  
Implement a unique identifier (e.g., student ID) for each student to handle duplicates better.

**Justification:**  
Using names as unique identifiers is unreliable; a unique ID ensures data integrity and accurate student identification.

**Updated Behavior:**  
- Introduce a unique student identifier.
- Update commands and data storage to use the new primary key.

---

### **Enhancement 5: Support Special Characters in Names and Class Fields**

**Current Issue:**  
The `addCommand` cannot handle special characters in names, such as "s/o" due to character restrictions.

**Proposed Enhancement:**  
Allow special characters in student names and class fields.

**Justification:**  
Support for special characters improves data accuracy and reflects real-life names more accurately.

**Updated Behavior:**  
- Adjust input validation to permit special characters in names and class fields.

---

### **Enhancement 6: Support Additional Student Information**

**Current Issue:**  
The `Person` object has limited attributes, missing information such as grades, attendance, and guardian details.

**Proposed Enhancement:**  
Extend the `Person` class to store additional information like grades, notes, and guardian contact details.

**Justification:**  
Comprehensive profiles assist educators in managing and understanding their students better, reducing tutor workload.

**Updated Behavior:**  
- Add new fields for grades, notes, and guardian information to the `Person` class.
- Update the UI to display this additional information.

---

### **Enhancement 7: Advanced Filtering Options for Students**

**Current Issue:**  
The `FindCommand` and `FindGroupCommand` are limited to name-based keyword searches, with no filtering by other criteria.

**Proposed Enhancement:**  
Expand filtering to allow users to search based on grades, attendance, class, and other attributes.

**Justification:**  
Enhanced filtering enables efficient student management, helping users find students that meet specific criteria.

**Updated Behavior:**  
- Add a `filter` command to allow searching and sorting by various attributes like grades, attendance, and class.

---



### **Enhancement 8: Precise Student Name Searching**

**Current Issue:**  
The `FindCommand` does not support keywords with whitespace, making it challenging to search for full names.

**Proposed Enhancement:**  
Enable search functionality to handle keywords with spaces, allowing precise name searches.

**Justification:**  
Allowing whitespace in searches improves accuracy, letting users find specific names like "Gong Yi" easily.

**Updated Behavior:**  
- Update the `find` command to accept phrases enclosed in quotes for exact matches.
- Enhance parsing to handle whitespace in keywords.

--- 

This updated format uses consistent headings, clearer language, and cleaner formatting, improving readability and organization.
