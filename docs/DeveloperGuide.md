## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="700"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="650" />

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The filter mechanism is facilitated by `FilterCommand`. It allows users to filter the contact list based on names and/or tags. The feature is implemented using predicates that check for matches in both the contact names and tags.

The filter feature implements the following operations:

* `FilterCommand#execute()` — Applies the filter criteria to the address book's contact list
* `FilterCommandParser#parse()` — Parses the user input into name and tag criteria
* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` — Updates the displayed list based on the filter predicate

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application. The contact list shows all contacts without any filters applied.

**Step 2.** The user executes `filter n\John t\friend t\client` command to show only contacts named "John" who are tagged as both "friend" and "client". The filter mechanism works as follows:

1. `FilterCommandParser` tokenizes the input and extracts:
    * Names: ["John"]
    * Tags: ["friend", "client"]<br><br>

2. A new `FilterCommand` is created with these criteria.

3. The `execute()` method creates a predicate that:
    * Checks if the contact's name contains "John" (case-insensitive)
    * Verifies the contact has both the "friend" and "client" tags
    * Only displays contacts meeting all criteria<br><br>

4. The filtered list is updated through `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`

**Step 3.** The user executes `filter t\work` to show only work contacts. This creates a new filter that:
* Clears the previous name filter
* Shows only contacts tagged as "work"

**Step 4.** The user executes `list` to show all contacts again, removing any active filters.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Filter Sequence Diagram" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a filter command:

<puml src="diagrams/FilterCommandActivityDiagram.puml" alt="FilterCommand Activity Diagram" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How filter matching is performed

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Matches name by containment and tags by exact match
    * Pros: More flexible name matching allows partial matches
    * Cons: May return unintended matches for short name queries<br><br>

* **Alternative 2**: Exact matching for both names and tags
    * Pros: More precise results
    * Cons: Users need to type exact names, which is less convenient<br><br>

##### Aspect: Handling multiple filter criteria

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: AND operation between name and tags, AND between multiple tags
    * Pros: Returns more focused results
    * Cons: May return empty results if criteria are too strict<br><br>

* **Alternative 2**: OR operation between all criteria
    * Pros: More likely to return results
    * Cons: May return too many unrelated results<br><br>

### Tagging Duplicate Phone Numbers

#### Implementation

The detection and tagging of duplicate phone numbers mechanism is facilitated by `DuplicatePhoneTagger`. It tracks duplicate phone numbers across all persons in the address book and automatically tags persons who share the same phone number with a "DuplicatePhone" tag. This mechanism is integrated into commands that can modify a person's phone number or the entire list, such as `add`, `edit` and `delete`.

The `DuplicatePhoneTagger` implements the following key operations:
* `DuplicatePhoneTagger#updateFrequenciesOfPhones()` — Counts and stores the frequency of each phone number
* `DuplicatePhoneTagger#updatePersonsList()` — Updates the tags of all persons based on whether their phone numbers are duplicates
* `DuplicatePhoneTagger#tagPhoneDuplicates()` — Main method that coordinates the duplicate phone tagging process

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the duplicate phone tagging mechanism behaves when executing an edit command.

1. Assume the address book has two persons: Alex (phone: 87654321) and Bob (phone: 91234567). With Alex being the 1st entry in the address book and Bob being the 2nd.

2. The user executes `edit 2 p/87654321` to change Bob's phone number to match Alex's.

3. The `edit` command first creates the modified person with the new phone number.

4. After the person is edited, `DuplicatePhoneTagger#tagPhoneDuplicates()` is called. This updates the frequency count of all phone numbers and identifies that "87654321" appears twice.

5. Finally, both Alex and Bob are tagged with the "DuplicatePhone" tag since they share the same phone number.

The following sequence diagrams show how the detection of duplicate phone numbers is carried out in the case of the `edit` operation being executed.

<puml src="diagrams/EditSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Edit Sequence Diagram" />

<puml src="diagrams/DuplicatePhoneTaggerSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Duplicate Phone Tagger Sequence Diagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, the duplicate phone tagging process will not be triggered, so the tags will remain unchanged.

</box>

#### Design considerations

##### Aspect: When to perform duplicate phone tagging

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Perform tagging after any command that could modify phone numbers
    * Pros: Ensures tags are always up-to-date
    * Cons: May have slight performance impact for commands that modify multiple persons<br><br>

* **Alternative 2:** Only check for duplicates when explicitly requested
    * Pros: Better performance as checking is done on-demand
    * Cons: Tags could become outdated if users forget to run the check<br><br>

##### Aspect: Storage of phone number frequencies

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a HashMap to store phone frequencies
    * Pros: O(1) lookup time for checking duplicates
    * Cons: Additional memory usage to maintain the HashMap<br><br>

* **Alternative 2:** Check for duplicates by scanning the person list
    * Pros: No additional data structures needed
    * Cons: O(n²) time complexity for checking duplicates<br><br>

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, MacOS
* **Command-line Interface (CLI)**: A text-based user interface where the user interacts with the application by typing commands, as opposed to a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* **Typical Usage**: The expected day-to-day usage of the application by the target user, which should not cause significant performance degradation.
* **Above-average Typing Speed**: A typing speed that is higher than the average user (40 words per minute), allowing the user to input commands and data more efficiently.
* **Platform-specific dependencies**:  Additional software required to run the application due to differences in Mainstream OS.
* **Local data file**: File stored on and only on the user's computer/device running the application.
* **Sensitive Data**: Data in any form (often text) that may harm the user or persons if exposed to unwanted parties (e.g. financial data, credit card info)
* **File Manager**: OS-specific software that allows user to view and manage (create, delete etc) files on their computer/device. Often comes pre-installed as part of the OS.
* **CSV**: Type of format of file that stores data in an ordered fashion using rows and columns. Often used in third-party spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel.
* **Tag**: Form of text-based labelling to categorise persons or data for organisation.

   1. **Prerequisites:** Have a list of contacts available to export.

   2. **Test case:** Run the `export format\csv` command

   3. **Expected:** Contacts are exported to a file in CSV format. Verify that all contact details are present in the file.

### Saving data

1. **Dealing with missing/corrupted data files**

   1. **Prerequisites:** BA€ is not running
   
   2. **Test case:**
   
      1. To simulate a corrupted file, navigate to the data folder, and find bae_addressbook.json
      
      2. Delete bae_addressbook.json
      
      3. Launch BA€.
      
   3. **Expected:** A new addressbook.json file will be created and it will be empty.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Accept more symbols in names**: When adding or editing the details of a contact, the `NAME` field currently does accept certain symbols, such as `/` and `'`, there are other symbols that a user could desire to add to the `NAME` of a contact that are currently not accepted. This can include, but is not limited to, `,`, `-`, `(`, `)`, `.` or accented characters. We plan to adjust the validation RegEx of the `NAME` class to allow these other characters.
2. **Improve duplicate contact detection**: When adding or editing the details of a contact, the duplicate detection feature currently compares `NAME` only. This could result in an inconvenience to the user should they choose to add multiple contacts with the same `NAME`. Hence, we plan to extend the current system of detecting duplicates based on `NAME` to one that detects duplicates by comparing multiple fields, such as but not limited to, `NAME`and `EMAIL`, and only considering a contact to be a duplicate of an existing one if both (or multiple) fields match in value.
3. **Accept multiple phone numbers**: Currently, each contact can only have one `PHONE_NUMBER`, which may inconvenience some users who may wish to add contacts with multiple `PHONE_NUMBER`s. We plan to adjust the manner in which  `PHONE_NUMBER`s are stored, using a set similar to the manner in which `Tag` is stored, so that users are able to add more than one `PHONE_NUMBER`.
4. **Accept more types of characters in phone numbers**: Currently, the `PHONE_NUMBER` field in each contact does not currently allow characters other than `+` and numbers. While as per the ITU-T, additional characters are not a strict necessity for a `PHONE_NUMBER` to be usable globally, users in certain regions may prefer the inclusion of additional characters to improve readability. Additional characters can include, but are not limited to, ` ` (whitespace), `-`, `(` or `)`. We plan to add support for these additional characters by adjusting the validation RegEX in the Phone class.
5. **Accept multiple social media handles**: Currently, there can be only 0 or 1 `SOCIALMEDIAHANDLE` stored for a given contact, and should an `add` or `edit` command with more than one `s\SOCIALMEDIAHANDLE` field be entered, only the last one would be stored. Some users may prefer to store multiple `SOCIALMEDIAHANDLE`s of their contacts, perhaps if the contact has different handles for different platforms, or different purposes. Hence, we plan to store `SOCIALMEDIAHANDLE` in a set so that contacts can have more than 1 `SOCIALMEDIAHANDLE`.
6. **Accept multiple pieces of financial information**: Currently, there can be only 0 or 1 `FINANCIALINFO` stored for a given contact, and should an `add` or `edit` command with more than one `fi\FINANCIALINFORMATION` field be entered, only the last one would be stored. Some users may prefer to store multiple pieces of `FINANCIALINFO` of their contacts for different purposes. Hence, we plan to store `FINANCIALINFO` in a set so that contacts can have more than 1 piece of `FINANCIALINFO`.
7. **Add horizontal scroll bar to UI to prevent text truncation**: Currently, if a user enters a very long value for certain fields, such as, but not limited to, `NAME` or `ADDRESS`, and the application is open in a window that is not wide enough to display the entire value of that field, the value will be truncated with `...` at the end. This could cause inconvenience to certain users, who may not be able to view the entire value as a result. Thus, we plan to modify the UI to create a horizontal scroll bar so that the user can see the entire value instead of it being truncated.
8. **Accept negative numbers and mathematical expressions in Tag names and values**: Currently, the `TAG` and `TAG:value`'s TagName and TagValue fields do not accept mathematical symbols or expressions, including, but not limited to, `+`, `-`, `*` or `/`, along with negative numbers. This could cause an inconvenience to certain users, who may wish to store `TAG`s with such information. Hence, we intend to adjust the validation RegEx of the `Tag` class to allow for such expressions.
9. **Block fullscreen of application in Unix and Unix-Like systems**: On certain systems running Unix-based or Unix-like operating systems, including but not limited to MacOS, Linux and its distributions, making the application run in full screen mode leads to slightly buggy behaviour in the GUI, such as the Help window not scaling fully to the size of the display. This may inconvenience users who attempt to run the application in fullscreen mode. Hence, we intend to modify the `UiManager` file to block attempts for Unix-based and Unix-like operating systems from making the application run in fullscreen mode.
10. **Include a more specific error for exporting on Windows**: On systems running Windows, if a user has a previous export's CSV or TXT file open in another application (for instance, Microsoft Excel or Notepad), and they attempt to use the `export` command, they will see a standard export failure error. This may not be sufficiently specific to inform users of the reason for the error. Thus, we intend to modify the `ExportCommand` class to detect such an issue and remind the user to close the previously exported file if they have it open.
