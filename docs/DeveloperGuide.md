### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

Here are more examples of how our commands work:

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("socialMedia 1 ig/username")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `socialMedia 1 ig/username` Command](images/SocialMediaSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SocialMediaCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("schedule 1 sd/2024-10-24")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `schedule 1 sd/2024-10-24` Command](images/ScheduleSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ScheduleCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("sort n/asc"")` API call as an example.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sort n/asc` Command](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>



The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("backup"")` API call as an example.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `backup` Command](images/BackupSequenceDiagram.png)





### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

Note that the Person class requires at least one of Phone, Address, Email or Social Media to be present. This cannot be captured by the UML. <br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* small business owners
* sole proprietors

**Value proposition**: Since these businesses are single-individual teams, keeping track of different stakeholders alone is a hassle. These individuals work on their computers at least for their networking purposes, making the product compatible with their existing workflows. The product is an easy-to-use contact management app that manages customers, business partners and suppliers.

## **Appendix: Effort**

This section describes the difficulties and challenges faced while working on this Brownfield project.
We detail some achievements accomplished by completing our iteration of the project.

1. Our team has a smaller number of members (only 4 members, compared to the norm of 5), so more complex features could not have been implemented. <br>
   We instead focused on features that are useful to users, and thought about our key value proposition, whilst maintaining the fact that the app is primarily for contact management.
2. Testing was an aspect that we found tedious and required a lot of effort. <br>
   Relying on the testing code infrastructure used in AB3 greatly helped to make the testing process more modular. <br>
   For example, when creating the tests for the `schedule` command, it was greatly inspired by the existing test infrastructure of the `edit` command.
3. While our project still focuses on managing contacts like AB3, our project introduces more complexity by managing multiple more entity types like schedules and social media while also incorporating viewing, utility and data management features.
   This required careful planning and integration to ensure compatibility between functions while ensuring ease of use for the users

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 4

1.	**Option to remove social media handles**: Currently, users are only allowed to add and update a contact's social media.
We plan to allow users to have the option to remove the handle by a command as such: `socialMedia INDEX` while will delete
the social media handle for the contact at `INDEX`.
2.	**Duplicate detection for `name` field**: Currently, duplicate names are not allowed (case-specific) EG. `John Doe` and 
another `John Doe` is not allowed. In the future, we will allow duplicate names considering some names are very common
while also notify the user of the name duplication Eg. `New person added: John Doe; Phone: 12345678. Note that there is already
an existing contact with the name John Doe.`. Additionally, near-matches (same spelling, different cases) will be considered: Adding `john doe` when there is already
a `John Doe` will also result in the duplication notification.
3.	**Enhance `name` field to accept more special characters**: Currently, we only accept alphanumeric characters in a contact's name.
We plan to expand this restriction to include other characters such as `-`, `/`, and `'` to accommodate for a bigger variety of names.
4.	**Phone number validation to allow more lengths and country code**: Currently, there is a limit of 8 - 15 
numeric digits allowed for contacts' phone number, but some countries have phone numbers longer than 15. We plan to
expand the limit to 3 - 20, and allow the inclusion of the `+` character for users to indicate country codes if needed.
5.	**More specific error messages so that the messages are not too long to improve readability**: Some of our error messages
such as the one for `add` can get a little long and users have to scroll to read the entire message. This message is shown regardless
of the type of error (invalid input, format issues) which results in the error message having to include much information about `add`.
We plan to use more specific error messages like `Invalid email! Emails must have multiple domains` and `Invalid prefix! Valid prefixes: n/NAME [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [sn/SCHEDULE_NAME] [sd/SCHEDULE_DATE] [st/SCHEDULE_TIME] 
[cs/SOCIAL_MEDIA_HANDLE] [fb/SOCIAL_MEDIA_HANDLE] [ig/SOCIAL_MEDIA_HANDLE] [t/TAG]...` to shorten each error message and
let the user know which specific problem he is facing.
6.	**Allow a contact to have multiple phone numbers, emails, addresses and social media handles**: Currently, each contact
can only have 1 phone number, email, address and social media handle. We plan to accept multiple fields. Here is an example 
in the context of `socialMedia`:
If the contact at index 2 already has the social media handle `[ig-alexyeoh]`, 
running `socialMedia 2 fb/alexyh` will just update the handle to `[fb-alexyh]` instead of adding a Facebook handle on top 
of the Instagram one. We plan to improve on this, such that running `socialMedia 2 ig/alexyeoh fb/alexyh` will add both handles
to the contact, and running `socialMedia 2 fb/alexyh` when the contact already has `[ig-alexyeoh]` will add the handle `[fb-alexyh]` 
instead of replacing `[ig-alexyeoh]`.
7.	**If `edit` command does not actually edit the contact, raise an error message to the user**: Currently, if the user uses
the `edit` command on a contact but is editing it to the original details anyway (basically no change to the contact),
the `edit` success message will be shown, which can be misleading. We plan to return an error message `There was no change to the contact!` 
to notify the user instead.
8.  **Additional validation checks for email address**: Currently, we accept single domain email addresses, but we have realised
that it can cause security issues. So, we plan to add the restriction where each email address must have more than one domain label,
else an error message will be shown. Eg. `johnd@example` will no longer be accepted and only those with multiple domains can be
accepted Eg. `johnd@example.com`.
