### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete Alice`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Reminder` object residing in the `Model`. (For e.g. `PersonListPanel` , `PersonCard`, `ReminderListPanel`, `ReminderCard`)

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete Alice")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete Alice` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ClientHubParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ClientHubParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the client hub data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all Reminders(which are contained in a ReminderList object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _sorted_ list composed using a _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Client Type` list in the `ClientHub`, which `Person` references. This allows `ClientHub` to only require one `ClientType` object per unique client type, instead of each `Person` needing their own `ClientType` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both ClientHub data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ClientHubStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Reminder Feature

#### Implementation
The add reminder mechanism is done by altering the `ReminderList` which is
facilitated by `ClientHub` class. Additionally , `ClientHub` also implements
the following operations:
- `ClientHub#editReminder()` - Edits the reminder in the reminder list.
- `ClientHub#deleteReminder()` - Deletes the reminder from the reminder list.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add reminder mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ClientHub` will be initialized with an empty reminder list and an initial.
Client list.

Step 2. The user finds a client in the client list to add a reminder for e.g. `Alice Pauline`. The
User will then execute `radd n/Alice Pauline dt/2022-10-10 12:00 d/lunch` command to add a reminder for Alice Pauline.
The `radd` command calls `ClientHub#addReminder()`, causing the reminder to be added to the reminder list.


The following sequence diagram shows how an add reminder operation goes through the `Logic` component:
![AddReminderSequenceDiagram-Logic.png](images/AddReminderSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

Similarly, how an add reminder operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:
![AddReminderSequenceDiagram-Model.png](images/AddReminderSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add reminder command:
![AddReminderCommandActivity.png](images/AddReminderCommandActivity.png)

   1. Prerequisites: List all clients using the `list` command. Multiple clients in the list.

   2. Test case: `delete Ahmad`<br>
      Expected: Contact with name "Ahmad" is deleted. Details of the deleted client shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   3. Test case: `delete x` (where x is a number) <br>
      Expected: No client is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete` `delete [NAME]` (with a client not in the list) <br>

   2. Exit ClientHub with `exit` or closing the window.
   3. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. <br>
      Expected: Changes made previously are loaded into the displayed data

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

Given below are some planned future enhancements for the app.

1. **Make Find Stackable:** The current find does not stack on top of each other.
We plan to make it able to stack. For example, doing a `find n/Alice` into a `find p/9874`
will first find all clients that have the name `Alice` and then find the clients in this filtered list that have a phone number
with `9874`.


2. **Disallow Duplicate Phone Numbers:** Currently, the app allows the user to add clients with the same phone number which
generally does not occur, thus we plan to make the app disallow adding clients with the same phone number, which will prevent
any accidental additions of clients with the same phone number.


3. **Allow Phone Numbers of different lengths:** Currently, the app only allows phone numbers of 8 for Singaporean Phone numbers, we plan to make the app
able to take in Numbers from other countries such as Malaysia to accommodate to FAs that have clients outside of Singapore


4. **More flexible Add:** Currently, the app requires the user to input all fields when adding a client, we plan to make the app more flexible by allowing the user to input only the necessary fields when adding a client.
Certain fields such as Description and Address may be unnecessary for some FAs to keep track of. So to increase their efficiency, we plan to make the app allow the user to input only the necessary fields when adding a client
such as Name, Phone Number and Client Type.


5. **All for more flexible Reminder Editing:** Currently, the app only allows the user to edit the name of a person if they have no reminders,
this is quite restrictive and may cause some inconveniences for users. Thus, we plan to make the app allow the user to edit the name of a person even if
they have reminders. This will allow the user to make changes to the client's name without having to delete all the reminders first.


6. **Improved display message for duplicate reminders:** Currently, the app displays a successful message when the user add a reminder that already exists, but it doesn't actually add the reminder to the reminder list. This may cause some inconveniences for the user as they may not be aware that they have added a duplicate reminder. Thus, we plan to make the app provide a specific display message when the user tries to add a reminder that already exists.


7. **Optimised Exit:** Currently, the app does not hide all `view` popups when user exits the app. This may cause some confusion for the user when the user exits the app as they would expect all modals and popups to close as well when they exit the app. Thus, we plan to make the app hide all `view` popups when the user exits the app.


8. **More restrictive Clear:** Currently, the app allows the user to clear all clients and reminders without any confirmation, this may cause some inconveniences for the user if they accidentally clear all clients and reminders. Thus, we plan to make the app require the user to confirm before clearing all clients and reminders.


9. **Add visual warnings to past dates for reminders:** Currently, the app does not provide any visual warnings for reminders that are added with dates past the current date. This may cause some inconveniences for the user as they may not be aware that they have added reminders with past dates. Thus, we plan to make the app provide visual warnings for reminders that are added with dates past the current date.


10. **Add more intuitive error message for the add reminder feature:** Currently, the app only provides a general error message. This may cause some inconveniences for the user as they may not be aware of what went wrong. Thus, we plan to make the app provide more intuitive error messages for the add reminder feature. For example, if the user tries to add a reminder but forgot to pass in a `DATETIME`, the app will provide an error saying that the user is missing the `DATETIME` field.
