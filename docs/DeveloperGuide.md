## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `WeddingListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` and `Wedding` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueWeddingList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` and/or `Wedding` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### Adding a new wedding
<puml src="diagrams/PersonClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />
<puml src="diagrams/WeddingClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

1. **Identifying the Client**:
    - The client for the new wedding is identified either by their index in the filtered person list or by their name.

2. **Validating the Client**:
    - Before creating the new wedding, the `AddwCommand` checks if the selected client is already associated with another wedding.

3. **Creating the Wedding**:
    - Once the client is validated, the `AddwCommand` creates a new `Wedding` object with the provided details (name, client, date, and venue).

4. **Checking for Duplicates**:
    - The `AddwCommand` checks if the new wedding already exists in the address book.

5. **Updating the Model**:
    - If the new wedding passes all the validation checks, the `AddwCommand` adds the wedding to the model.
    - It also sets the client's own wedding to the new wedding using the `setOwnWedding` method of the `Person` class.

6. **Returning the Result**:
    - Finally,  the success message is displayed to the user.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Our team size is 5 which allows for **10** planned enhancements.

1. **Accept Special Characters in Names**:
   - Extend current name field validations to support special characters, such as periods, slashes (s/o, d/o), and other symbols found in legal names.
   - This enhancement will allow for more accurate and comprehensive name entries

2. **Restrict Wedding Date to Five Years into the Future**:
    - Add a validation to ensure that the wedding date entered is within five years of the current date
    - This will help maintain realistic and relevant wedding planning data

3. **Allow Deletion of Wedding Date and Venue**:
    - Expand functionality of edit wedding feature to delete individual wedding date and associated venue information
    - This will allow users to remove outdated or irrelevant wedding details from the system

4. **Prevent Double-Booking of Vendors**:
    - Enhance the assign wedding feature to check for and prevent vendors from being assigned to multiple weddings on the same date
    - Display an appropriate error message if a user attempts to book a vendor who is already assigned to another wedding on the same date

5. **Provide Vendor Conflict Information in Error Messages**:
    - When a vendor is already assigned to another wedding, and users attempt to assign them to that same wedding, 
        include the details of the conflicting wedding in the error message
    - This will help users quickly identify the source of the conflict and take appropriate action

6. **Ensure Full Display of Long Fields in the GUI**:
    - Optimize the GUI to display the full contents of long fields (more than 50 characters) without truncation
    - Implement responsive design or scrolling mechanisms to ensure all relevant information is visible to the user

7. **Improve Error Messages for Large Number Inputs**:
    - Enhance the error messaging displayed when a user enters a number that is too large for the system to handle
    - Provide clear and actionable guidance to the user on the appropriate range of values

8. **Allow Users to "Unclick" Fields in the GUI**:
    - Add the ability for users to "unclick" or deselect fields in the GUI after they have been clicked
    - This will improve the user experience and provide more flexibility when interacting with the application

9. **Ensure GUI Responsiveness to Window Size Adjustments**:
    - Optimize the GUI to properly display wedding details and information regardless of the window size
    - Implement responsive design techniques to ensure the application remains usable and visually appealing when the window size is adjusted

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance Requirements:**
    - **Response Time:** The system should respond to user commands within **1 second** under normal operating conditions (e.g., managing up to **50 weddings** and **500 contacts**). This ensures the application remains efficient for fast typists and small to medium-sized wedding organizers.
    - **Startup Time:** The system should start up and be fully usable within **5 seconds** on modern machines (e.g., with at least 4GB RAM), ensuring quick access without reliance on any installer or external dependencies.

2. **Portability:**
    - The system must work cross-platform on **Windows 10/11** and **macOS 10.15 (Catalina)** or later, running **Java 17** and above. It should avoid the use of platform-specific libraries or features, ensuring it can be used by a wide range of users across different environments.
    - The product must be packaged as a single **JAR file** to comply with the single-file packaging constraint, avoiding external dependencies that could complicate installation or distribution.

3. **Usability:**
    - The system should offer a **CLI-first experience** optimized for fast typists, with a user interface that caters to wedding organizers who prefer text-based commands.
    - The GUI should primarily provide feedback and display information, while command-based input remains the primary interaction method.

4. **Data Storage:**
    - All data should be stored locally in a human-readable format (e.g., JSON), allowing users to back up and edit data manually if necessary.
    - The system should not require a database management system (DBMS), ensuring ease of setup and maintenance.

5. **Reliability and Fault Tolerance:**
    - The system should have robust error handling that gives users clear feedback when errors occur.
    - In case of errors, the system should allow users to retry operations or resolve issues without losing data.

6. **Maintainability:**
    - The codebase should follow **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and be modular to facilitate future maintenance and extension.
    - Each component should be well-documented and follow best practices to ensure maintainability.
    - Incremental updates are recommended to align with the **Incremental Delivery** approach, ensuring that the product evolves gradually.

7. **Testability:**
    - The system should include unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.
    - Manual testing should be straightforward, with clear feedback provided to testers. Detailed instructions for manual testing should be provided in the developer documentation.

8. **Documentation:**
    - Both **User Guide** and **Developer Guide** must be provided.
    - The User Guide should explain how to interact with the CLI and manage wedding data.
    - The Developer Guide should detail system architecture, design decisions, and instructions for extending the application.

9. **Compliance:**
    - The system must operate entirely offline without dependence on a remote server, ensuring data privacy and usability without internet access.
    - Legal compliance should be considered regarding data storage and user privacy, but given the local nature of data storage, extensive data security measures are not required.

10. **Graphical Interface:**
    - The GUI should be responsive and display correctly on common screen resolutions, including when the application window is maximized.
    - The interface should be usable on screens with resolutions of **1280x720** and higher.

### Removing wedding jobs assigned to a person

#### Removing with INDEX of person list and wedding list

1. Removing wedding jobs assigned to a person while all weddings are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all persons and weddings using the `list` command. Multiple persons and weddings in the list.<br>

    1. Test case: `delete 1 w/1`<br>
       Expected: First wedding is unassigned from first person. Details of the unassigned contact shown in the status message. <br>

    1. Test case: `delete 0 w/1`<br>
       Expected: No person to unassign wedding job. `delete` command format is shown in the status message.<br>

    1. Test case: `delete 1 w/x` (where x is outside the range of wedding list or a non-numeric character)<br>
       Expected: Error message prompting the user to choose an index within the range shown.<br>

1. Removing wedding jobs assigned to a person while a partial list of weddings is shown.

    1. Prerequisite: List some of the weddings using `vieww NAME`, where a partial list of weddings that matches NAME will be shown, assuming there are multiple of such weddings.

    1. Test cases used are similar, except that the index will follow that of the shown list.

#### Removing with NAME of person and INDEX of wedding list

1. Since `delete NAME w/1` searches from the entire list of contacts, rather than only the partial list, it works either way.

    1. Test case: `delete Alice Tan w/1` <br>
       Expected (Unique Alice Tan): The contact of `Alice Tan` will be unassigned from wedding at index 1. Details of the unassigned contact shown in the status message. <br>
       Expected (Duplicated Alice Tan): Contacts with name field containing `Alice Tan` exactly will be shown. Status message prompts user to re-input using index according to the newly filtered list to specify which `Alice Tan` they want to unassign. <br>
       Expected (No Alice Tan): No person to unassign. Error details is shown in the status message, as the NAME does not belong to anyone in the address book.


### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

    1. Prerequisites: Have the app running with some sample data saved

    2. Test case: Delete addressbook.json
        * Steps:
            1. Navigate to data folder (default: `[App Home]/data/`)
            2. Delete `addressbook.json`
            3. Restart the application
        * Expected:
            - App creates new `addressbook.json` with empty data
            - Creata a new data file data/addressbook.json populated with a sample AddressBook.
    
    3. Test case: Corrupt addressbook.json with invalid JSON
        * Steps:
            1. Navigate to data folder
            2. Open `addressbook.json`
            3. Add random text or remove brackets to make it invalid JSON
            4. Save file and restart application
        * Expected:
            - Creates new `addressbook.json` with empty data
            - Status bar shows "Corrupted data found. Starting with empty address book"
            - List shows no persons or weddings

    4. Test case: Corrupt addressbook.json with valid JSON but invalid data
        * Steps:
            1. Navigate to data folder
            2. Open `addressbook.json`
            3. Modify data while keeping valid JSON structure (e.g., remove required fields, change data types)
            4. Save file and restart application
        * Expected:
            - Creates new `addressbook.json` with empty data
            - Status bar shows "Corrupted data found. Starting with empty address book"
            - List shows no persons or weddings

2. Testing data persistence

    1. Test case: Normal shutdown
        * Steps:
            1. Modify data (add/edit/delete person or wedding)
            2. Exit application through UI
            3. Restart application
        * Expected: All modifications are preserved

    2. Test case: Forced shutdown
        * Steps:
            1. Modify data
            2. Force close application (Task Manager/Force Quit)
            3. Restart application
        * Expected:
            - Last saved state (address book after last valid command executed) is recovered.
            - Any unsaved modifications are lost
            - No data corruption

3. Testing data integrity

    1. Test case: Wedding-Person relationship integrity
        * Steps:
            1. Open `addressbook.json`
            2. Manually modify wedding references (change hashcodes)
            3. Save file and restart application
        * Expected:
            - Changing ownWedding field of a person to 0 will only result in wedding having no client and would not corrupt the file.
            - App detects corrupted relationships
            - Shows error message: "Address book data is corrupted: Found weddings without corresponding clients"
            - Starts with empty address book

    2. Test case: Client-Wedding integrity
        * Steps:
            1. Open `addressbook.json`
            2. Manually remove client data while keeping wedding reference
            3. Save file and restart application
        * Expected:
            - App detects missing client data
            - Shows error message about corrupted data
            - Starts with empty address book
