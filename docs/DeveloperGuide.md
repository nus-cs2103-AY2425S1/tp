## **Design**

### Architecture

The ***Architecture Diagram*** below explains the high-level design of the DocTrack application.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280"></puml>

<br><br>

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<br>

#### Main components of the architecture

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

<br>

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of DocTrack.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of DocTrack in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<br>

#### How the architecture components interact with each other

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other, for the scenario where the user enters the command `delete  person 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574"></puml>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the 
  corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class _(reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component)_, as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300"></puml>

<br><br>

The sections below give more details of each component.

<br>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"></puml>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` or `Appointment` object residing in the `Model`.

<br>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"></puml>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"></puml>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<br>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="750"></puml>

The `Model` component,

* with regards to `Person` objects:
  * stores the details of a person in a `PersonDescriptor` object
  * stores the `PersonDescriptor` object with a `personId` in the `Person` class.
  * stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
  * stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* with regards to `Appointment` objects:
  * stores the details of an appointment in an `AppointmentDescriptor` object
  * stores the `AppointmentDescriptor` object with a `Person` and `appointmentId` in the `Appointment` class.
  * stores the address book data i.e., all `Appointment` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueAppointmentList` object).
  * stores the currently 'selected' `Appointment` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Appointment>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list (the 
`UniqueTagList`) in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects. Similarly, the `Appointment` objects are shown as such too.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="750"></puml>

</box>

<br>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="650"></puml>

* The `Storage` component can save patient data, appointment data, and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* The `Storage` interface inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `AppointmentBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* Patient data: 
  * Data is saved in `JsonAddressBookStorage` which inherits from interface `AddressBookStorage`.
  * Data is saved as `JsonSerializableAddressBook` which consists of `JsonAdaptedPerson` and 
    `JsonAdaptedTag` which embodies the actual data of the individual patient and their data
* Appointment data:
  * Data is saved in `JsonAppointmentBookStorage` which inherits from interface `AppointmentBookStorage`.
  * Data is saved as `JsonSerializableAppointmentBook` which consists of `JsonAdaptedAppointment` which 
    embodies the actual data of appointments and appointment details
* User Preference data:
    * Data is saved in `UserPrefsStorage` interface and saved as `JsonUserPrefsStorage`
* The `Storage` component depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<br>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

## **Flow**

The activity diagram shows the general sequence of steps when a user interacts with DocTrack.

<puml src="diagrams/OverallFlowActivityDiagram.puml" width="700"></puml>

1. The user types a command in the `CommandBox`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` parses the command.
3. If the command is a known command and is in a valid format, a parser creates the corresponding 
   `Command` object. Else, an error is displayed. 
4. The `Command` object is executed.
5. The `UI` displays the result of the command execution to the user.

<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<br>

## **Implementation of entity command features**

Entity commands include `add`, `delete`, `find`, `clear`, `edit`, and `list` commands. 
* Hence, `xyzCommand` can be `addCommand`, `deleteCommand`, `findCommand`, `clearCommand`, `editCommand`, or `listCommand`.

The sequence diagram shows how an entity command is executed:

<puml src="diagrams/EntityCommandSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EntityCommandSequenceDiagram"></puml>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** There are two entities, `Person` and `Appointment`.
- The entity referred in `FindEntityCommand` refers to `FindPersonCommand` and `FindAppointmentCommand`.
- Similarly, the entity referred in `AddEntityCommand` refers to `AddPersonCommand` and `AddAppointmentCommand`.
- This applies for the other commands as well.
</box>

**Step 1**. The user types an `xyz` command input in the `CommandBox`, followed by the type of entity, 
`person` or `appt`. This is followed by appropriate arguments and prefixes.


**Step 2**. The input is passed to the `LogicManager`. `LogicManager` then calls the 
`AddressBookParser::parseCommand` method to parse the input.


**Step 3**. The `AddressBookParser` parses the input and creates an `xyzCommandParser` object, which is 
returned to the `AddressBookParser`.


**Step 4**. The `AddressBookParser` calls the 
`xyzCommandParser::parse` method to parse the arguments. 


**Step 5**. The `xyzCommandParser` creates an `xyzCommand` object, which is returned to the `LogicManager`.


**Step 6**. The `LogicManager` calls the `xyzCommand : execute` method, which creates a `CommandResult` 
Object.


**Step 7**. The `CommandResult` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

<br>

### General Design Considerations

**Aspect: Whether to implement entity commands as separate commands or through an abstract base command**
- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Implement an abstract EntityCommand class that specific entity 
  commands (e.g. `AddPersonCommand`, `AddAppointmentCommand`, `DeletePersonCommand`, 
  `DeleteAppointmentCommand`) 
  inherit from.
  - **Pros**: Allows for reuse of code logic between entity commands.
  - **Cons**: Requires additional parsing logic since entity in command must be distinguished (person or appointment), which can add complexity.
- **Alternative 2:** Implement each entity command as entirely separate classes.
  - **Pros**: Creates a separate command, so the implementations of each command are separated and less coupled.
  - **Cons**: Results in significant code duplication.


<br>

**Aspect: What constitutes duplicate person that should not be added or edited into the AddressBook**
- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Duplicate person is one that has the same name (case-insensitive) and same phone number as an existing person
  - **Pros**: Name and phone numbers are identifiers that are commonly recognized by users.
  - **Cons**: Extra logic required to determine equality of different people.
- **Alternative 2:** A duplicate person is defined more loosely or strictly (e.g. by name only)
  - **Pros**: Less logic required to determine equality of different people.
  - **Cons**: Different people could have the same name, but cannot be added into the AddressBook.

<br>

**Aspect: What constitutes duplicate appointment that should not be added or edited into the AppointmentBook**
- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Duplicate appointment is one that has same person, date and time, and appointment type as an existing appointment
  - **Pros**: Provides a rule to avoid scheduling conflicts of same person.
  - **Cons**: Extra logic required to determine equality of different appointments.
- **Alternative 2:** Define duplicates with only the date and time
  - **Pros**: Less logic required to determine equality of different appointments.
  - **Cons**: Different appointments with different persons could have the same date time, but cannot be added 
    into the AppointmentBook.

<br>

### Command-Specific Design Considerations

#### Add Appointment feature

**Aspect: Whether appointment fields should be optional**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** `Sickness` and `Medicine` fields are optional.
    - **Pros**: This allows users to create an appointment without specifying all fields initially, which is more realistic and practical as some details may not be available at the time of creation.

- **Alternative 2**: Make all fields mandatory.
    - **Pros**: Ensures complete data at the time of appointment creation, which may simplify data handling and reduce the need for future edits.
    - **Cons**: Can be inconvenient for users who do not have all details available immediately, possibly leading to frustration or delays in creating appointments.

<br>

**Aspect: What Input Should Be Valid for Fields Sickness and Medicine**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Require input with at least one alphanumeric character.
    - **Pros**: Ensures these fields contain meaningful data, reducing the likelihood of accidental or erroneous inputs.

- **Alternative 2:** Allow any value as valid input.
    - **Cons**: Increases the risk of erroneous inputs, such as empty fields, accidental symbols, or irrelevant characters, potentially reducing data quality.


#### Delete/Clear Person feature

**Aspect: Deleting person and clearing person list should:**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** remove appointments with the `personId` of that person.
  - **Pros**: This prevents the case where appointments are linked to personIds that are non-existent.
- **Alternative 2:** not remove any appointments with the `personId` of that person.
  - **Cons**: This assumes the user would delete the appointments linked to the deleted person's `personId`. However, the user might forget to do so. 
  
<br>

#### Edit Person/Appointment feature

**Aspect: What value to use for indicating entity**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Use the index of the person/appointment in the list.
    - **Pros**: Enables efficient retrieval directly from the list using `List#get`, simplifying implementation.
    - **Cons**: Entity indexes may shift after deletions, which could lead to unintended edits if the user isn’t aware of changes in ordering.

- **Alternative 2:** Use a unique ID for each entity.
    - **Pros**: IDs remain consistent regardless of list modifications, ensuring stable reference to the entity.
    - **Cons**: Implementing ID-based retrieval requires additional logic and may be slower, especially for larger lists.

<br>

**Aspect: During Edit Appointment, check if new person ID associated with edited appointment corresponds to an existing person in the address book**
- This is to ensure no unwanted errors occur while editing the appointment and helps to maintain data integrity.

<br>

#### Find Person/Appointment feature

**Aspect: How to show find person/appointment based on different criteria**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice)**: Create one find command that supports filtering by multiple criteria (name, date) using prefixes.
  - Pros: Fast and easy to find by date and name
  - Cons: Confusing syntax from user's perspective

- **Alternative 2**: Create different find commands, find by date, find by name etc.
  - Pros: Much easy in terms of user experience
  - Cons: More repeated code for each command

<br>

**Aspect: How to combine multiple prefixes when finding results**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice)**: Prefixes should be combined using an AND condition.
  - Pros: Ensures more specific search results, as all conditions must be met
  - Cons: May be too restrictive

- **Alternative 2**: Prefixes should be combined using an OR condition
  - Pros: Allows for more flexible and broader search results, as any one of the conditions can yield matches.
  - Cons: May return too many results

<br>

**Aspect: Whether to implement case sensitivity in matching**

- **Alternative 1 (Current choice)**: Implement case-insensitive matching for search terms.
    - **Pros**: Enhances user experience by allowing searches to ignore case differences
    - **Cons**: Slightly more processing required to normalize case during search

- **Alternative 2**: Implement case-sensitive matching for search terms.
    - **Pros**: Potentially faster searches, as no additional case normalization is required
    - **Cons**: Reduces user-friendliness
<br>

<box type="tip" theme="success" seamless>

**Tip:**
To add a new predicate, navigate the corresponding entity folder in the model package. There, you can create a new class that implements `Predicate<Entity>`. Ensure that this method has a test method which defines the specific condition for a predicate.

</box>

---

<br>

## Implementation of general command features
General commands include the `exit` and `help` commands.

The sequence diagram shows how a general command (`ExitCommand` or `HelpCommand`) is executed:
<puml src="diagrams/GeneralCommandsSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600"></puml>

**Step 1.** The user types an `xyz` command (`exit` or `help`) in the `CommandBox`, which is then passed to the `LogicManager`.

**Step 2.** The `LogicManager` calls the `AddressBookParser::parseCommand` method to parse the `xyz` command.

**Step 3.** The `AddressBookParser` creates an `XYZCommand` object, which is returned to the 
`LogicManager`. The `XYZCommand` object can be an `ExitCommand` or a `HelpCommand`.

**Step 4.** The `LogicManager` calls the `XYZCommand::execute` method, which creates a new `CommandResult` 
object.

**Step 5.** The `CommandResult` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

<br>

### Exit feature
#### Implementation
When a user types an `exit` command, the DocTrack application will exit.
  
<br>

### Help feature
#### Implementation

When a user types a `help` command, the DocTrack application will display a `HelpWindow`.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to display help information:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Display help information in a new window.
  * Pros: Keeps the main application window uncluttered.
  * Cons: Requires managing an additional window.
* **Alternative 2:** Display help information in a modal dialog.
  * Pros: Simpler to implement.
  * Cons: Can clutter the main application window and interrupt the user's workflow.

<br>

## **Appendix: Miscellaneous Design Considerations**

### Data storage and files

**Aspect: Save patient and appointment data in:**
<br>
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** two different files, patient data in `data/addressbook.json` and appointment data in `data/appointmentbook.json`.
    * Pros: 
        * More organised file management
        * Quicker read and write times for each file
    * Cons: 
        * Higher chance of inconsistencies between patient and appointment data
* **Alternative 2:** one single file named `data/addressbook.json`
    * Pros:
        * Simplicity and convenience of one file for all information
    * Cons:
        * Slower read and write times for file, especially if the user is only accessing one of patient or appointment data.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Note:**
For `Appointment`, the fields `Sickness` and `Medicine` are optional. Hence, if `Sickness` or `Medicine` 
is not specified, it would be represented as `"null"`, in the `appointmentbook.json` file.
</box>

<br>

**Aspect: When the data is updated in the `.json` file:**
<br>
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Automatically save all changes after any command that changes the data. 
    * Pros: Simplifies the process for the user, without needing to save manually.
    * Cons: May be slow if there are many changes to save.
* **Alternative 2:** Prompt the user to save changes before exiting.
    * Pros: Gives the user more control over the saving process.
    * Cons: May be annoying for users who do not want an additional step to save changes.

<br>

### Parsing

**Aspect: How to parse the commands:**
<br>
Context: The commands (other than the general) have the command format: `COMMAND ENTITY_TYPE ENTITY_ARGS`
<br>
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Parse `ENTITY_TYPE` and `ENTITY_ARGS` separately.
    * Pros:
        * Easier to parse
        * Easier to debug, as the parsing is separated into different portions
    * Cons:
        * More verbose, and less centralised.
* **Alternative 2**: Parse them together.
    * Pros:
        * Everything is parsed together, centralising the parsing logic.
    * Cons:
        * Harder to parse and debug

<br>

**Aspect: Command format (with or without prefixes):**
<br>
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use prefixes
    * Pros:
        * Easier to identify markers for each parameter
        * Prefixes allow for free positioning of arguments
    * Cons:
        * Less intuitive for the user at start
        * Need to create prefixes
* **Alternative 2:** Use no prefixes
    * Parsing the arguments based on position.
    * Pros:
        * More intuitive at start
        * No need to create prefixes
    * Cons:
        * Harder to identify markers - may result in issues with arguments that have spaces in between
        * No free positioning
        * Might be harder to implement variable amount of arguments

<br>

**Aspect: `ArgumentMultimap` use across different entities:**
<br>
Context: The `ArgumentMultimap` is used across different entities.
<br>
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the same `ArgumentMultimap` for all entities.
    * Pros:
        * Prefixes are shared universally, making it more consistent across entities.
        * Less code duplication
    * Cons:
        * Might be more cluttered, as all the prefixes are together
        * Inability to use same prefixes for different arguments across entities
* **Alternative 2**: Use different `ArgumentMultimap` for each entity.
    * Pros:
        * Less cluttered, only prefixes for that entity will be addressed
        * Can use prefixes used in different entities for different arguments
    * Cons:
        * More code duplication, as there are shared prefixes
        * Might be harder to track shared prefixes, causing confusion to users

<br>

### User Interface

**Aspect: How to show appointment and person lists**
<br>
Context: There are two entity types (appointment and person) being managed in DocTrack
<br>
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show lists as two separate panels side by side
    * Pros:
        * Easier to see all information at once
        * Easier to cross reference when doing `add appt` or `edit appt` commands, which may need information about person ID
    * Cons:
        * More verbose and could result in information overload
* **Alternative 2**: Show only one list at a time, but toggle between the two using a `list appt` or `list person` command
    * Pros:
        * Information is simpler to digest
    * Cons:
        * More overhead of handling switching between lists
        * Difficult to cross reference when typing certain commands

<br>

**Aspect: Color Scheme**
<br>
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create new red, white and gray color scheme
    * Pros:
        * Creates brand identity
        * Makes the GUI more appealling to the target audience
    * Cons:
        * Constant oversight needed to maintain color scheme in future feature enhancements
* **Alternative 2:** Use the original AB3 gray color schee
    * Pros:
        * No extra effort needed
    * Cons:
        * Colors are not appealing
        * Colors are not professional and do not suit target audience

<br>

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
* General Practitioners (GPs) at small clinics

**Value proposition**: 
- Time spent looking through paper medical documents should be spent in other life-saving activities. 
- Our product, DocTrack, resolves this issue by creating fast access to patient contact details as well as their relevant appointment details, allowing GPs to contact and monitor their patients easily.

## **Appendix: Effort**
#### Difficulty Level
Our project presented a higher level of complexity compared to AB3. Our project involved handling multiple entity types, mainly persons and appointments, whereas AB3 manages only a single entity. This increased the requirements for command processing as each entity type has additional attributes and methods.

#### Challenges Faced
- **Integration of person and appointment entities**: To ensure that each appointment correctly linked to each patient, we introduced a `Patient` attribute to the `Appointment` class. 
- **Command Implementation**: Implementing commands for both entities required careful design to ensure that each command worked correctly for both entities.
- **Unique IDs**: To ensure each patient and appointment had a 
  unique ID to allow for easy retrieval and updating of data, we added a `personId` and `appointmentId` attribute to the `Person` and `Appointment` classes respectively.

#### Effort Required
Our project involved substantial effort in several key areas:
- **Design and Refactoring**: Extending the AB3 framework to handle two separate entity types required refactoring and designing new classes. 
- **Command Implementation**: In creating patient- and appointment-specific commands, we implemented additional parser classes and commands.
- **Testing and Debugging**: To ensure robust funtionality, we implemented comprehensive test cases. This was necessary to ensure 
  that each command and feature worked as expected for both entity types.

#### Achievements
Our project successfully expanded AB3’s functionality, enabling the application to manage patients and appointments. Despite the challenges, our final solution provides a user-friendly interface and coherent command structure. Additionally, the design allows for potential future expansion to include other entity types without extensive restructuring, making the system both flexible and scalable.
