## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_student 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete_student 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_student 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**


### Introduction
This section of the developer Guide covers how the features are implemented and executed.

### Features Overview
Listed below are the implemented features, and a brief description of what they do.
* **Adding a new Assignment**: Adds a new Assignment for a particular student
* **Grading an existing Assignment**: Grades an existing assignment belonging to an existing student
* **Deleting an existing Assignment**: Deletes an existing assignment belonging to an existing student
* **Viewing a student's details**: Displays students details along with the assignments associated with the student

## Adding a new Assignment
This `add_assignment` command is a feature that  allows the user to create a new assignment, based on the student's index. The assignment must have an alphanumeric `Name`, and a valid `Max Score`.

#### Design Considerations:
Previously, AB3 had a single command word for the `add` commands. As TAchy is a brownfield project, additional objects are now allowed to be instantiated via the `add` commmand.
In particular, TAchy has 2 features that "add" items to the app. Firstly, there is an `add_student` feature, and also an `add_assignment` feature.

**Aspect: How to distinguish between the different 'add' commands:**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Distinguish command word, and thus allow only 1 type of object to be created at a time.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, and less prone to Users making errors in command format
  * Cons: User will only be able to add either students or assignments, one at a time

* Alternative 2: Allow multiple objects to be created concurrently.
  * Pros: Allows adept users to create new objects in the app more quickly
  * Cons: Difficult to implement, and users are prone to making more mistakes in supplying the valid parameters used.


#### Implementation
* LogicManager executes the command "add_assignment".
* LogicManager parses the command via AddressBookParser.
* AddressBookParser creates and delegates parsing to AddAssignmentCommandParser.
* AddAssignmentCommandParser creates an AddAssignmentCommand object.
* AddAssignmentCommand is returned to AddAssignmentCommandParser and back to AddressBookParser.
* LogicManager then executes AddAssignmentCommand, which interacts with the Model.
* AddAssignmentCommand creates a CommandResult object.
* CommandResult is returned to AddAssignmentCommand, which returns the result to LogicManager.
* The sequence concludes with the return to the caller from LogicManager.
* This describes the flow of command execution, parsing, and interaction with the model.

#### Example invocation sequence for AddAssignmentCommand

#### Example activity diagram for AddAssignmentCommand
<puml src="diagrams/add-assignment/AddAssignmentActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Activities inside the Logic Component for the `add_assignment` Command" />


## Viewing a student's details
This `view_student` command is a feature that allows the user to expand and view all of a student's details in the details panel, based on the student's index.
Additional details such as a student's assignments and remarks, that are not visible in the list panel, will now also be visible in the details panel.

#### Design Considerations:
In order to select a student to be displayed on the detail's panel, the student has to be identified from the list of contacts.

**Aspect: Identifying the student to be displayed on the panel:**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Identify student by the student index.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, and less prone to Users making errors in command format.
    * Cons: The student index in the list may change every time the list is filtered, which may be confusing for the user as he has to check for the student index every time he calls this command.

* Alternative 2: Identify student by their name.
    * Pros: User will not have to check for the student index in the list every time he wants to call this command.
    * Cons: As TAchy allows multiple contacts to be saved with the same name, additional fields such as phone number will have to be used in conjunction with "name" in order to differentiate between them. This will make the implementation more complex.

#### Implementation
* LogicManager executes the command "view_student".
* LogicManager parses the command via AddressBookParser.
* AddressBookParser creates and delegates parsing to ViewStudentCommandParser.
* ViewStudentCommandParser creates an ViewStudentCommand object.
* ViewStudentCommand is returned to ViewStudentCommandParser and back to AddressBookParser.
* LogicManager then executes ViewStudentCommand, which interacts with the Model.
* ViewStudentCommand creates a CommandResult object.
* CommandResult is returned to ViewStudentCommand, which returns the result to LogicManager.
* The sequence concludes with the return to the caller from LogicManager.
* This describes the flow of command execution, parsing, and interaction with the model.

#### Example invocation sequence for ViewStudentCommand
<puml src="diagrams/ViewStudentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `view_student` Command" />

## Adding a remark to a student
This `remark` command allows the user to add a remark for a specific student.
The user must specify the student's index from the displayed list, followed by the remark to be added.

#### Design Considerations:
In order to add a remark to a student, the user must provide a number representing the student's index and remark string to get attached to that selected student from the list.

**Aspect: Identifying the student to add a remark to:**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Identify the student by their index.
    * Pros: Straightforward and easy to implement. Users only need to reference the index in the list to add a remark, which makes it less error prone.
    * Cons: The student index may change every time the list is filtered, so the user has to check for the student index every time the user before calling this command.

* Alternative 2: Identify student by their name.
    * Pros: Users do not have to worry about filtered indexes, so the user does not have to check the list every time before calling this command.
    * Cons: Since TAchy allows multiple contacts with the same name, the system may encounter ambiguity when handling duplicate names, so additional fields are required to uniquely identify the contacts.

#### Implementation
* LogicManager executes the command "remark".
* LogicManager parses the command via AddressBookParser.
* AddressBookParser creates and delegates parsing to RemarkCommandParser.
* RemarkCommandParser creates a RemarkCommand object.
* RemarkCommand is returned to RemarkCommandParser and back to AddressBookParser.
* LogicManager then executes RemarkCommand, which interacts with the Model.
* RemarkCommand creates a CommandResult object.
* CommandResult is returned to RemarkCommand, which returns the result to LogicManager.
* The sequence concludes with the return to the caller from LogicManager.
* This describes the flow of command execution, parsing, and interaction with the model.

`remark` Command" />

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
