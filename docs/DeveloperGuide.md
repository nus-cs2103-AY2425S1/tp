### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academyassist/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academyassist/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete S00001`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="400" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academyassist/ui/Ui.java).

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="750"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academyassist/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

Certain components will require the instance of the `Model` itself. For example,
* for example, `TrackSubjectWindow` requires information on the number of students taking each subject

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academyassist/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete S00001")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete S00001` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AcademyAssistParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="750"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AcademyAssistParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AcademyAssistParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

Output after parsing:
* If an invalid command is input, a help message is shown to a user to specify the proper use of the command.
* Depending on the parameters input by the user, the same command type can result in different outputs. 
  * For example, the `filter` command can filter by either `subject` or `yearGroup` as shown below.
  * Calling the `list` command reverts the shown list to show all students again.

<img src="images/FilterActivityDiagram.png" width="600"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academyassist/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="750" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/academyassist/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="750" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AcademyAssistStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.academyassist.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAcademyAssist`. It extends `AcademyAssist` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `academyAssistStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAcademyAssist#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current academy assist state in its history.
* `VersionedAcademyAssist#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous academy assist state from its history.
* `VersionedAcademyAssist#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone academy assist state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAcademyAssist()`, `Model#undoAcademyAssist()` and `Model#redoAcademyAssist()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAcademyAssist` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAcademyAssist()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `academyAssistStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAcademyAssist()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `academyAssistStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAcademyAssist()`, so the academy assist state will not be saved into the `academyAssistStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAcademyAssist()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous academy assist state, and restores the academy assist to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AcademyAssist state, then there are no previous AcademyAssist states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAcademyAssist()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAcademyAssist()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the academy assist to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `academyAssistStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest academy assist state, then there are no undone AcademyAssist states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAcademyAssist()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the academy assist, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAcademyAssist()`, `Model#undoAcademyAssist()` or `Model#redoAcademyAssist()`. Thus, the `academyAssistStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAcademyAssist()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `academyAssistStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire academy assist.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty
The development of **AcademyAssist** presented a moderate to high difficulty level to our team. The project required a 
solid understanding of Java programming, particularly in object-oriented design. Even though our team has prior experience
with Java, the complexity of the project demanded a deeper understanding of JavaFX, which was new to most of us. But with
the experience gained from developing the individual project before this, we were able to quickly adapt to the team project
development.

### Challenges Faced
The main challenges faced by our team during the development of **AcademyAssist** were:
1. **Designing the product**: The team had to spend a significant amount of time designing the product, including deciding
on the features to include, the architecture of the application, and the user interface design. This required a lot of
discussion and collaboration among team members.
2. **Data Validation**: Implementing robust validation for user inputs was essential to prevent errors and ensure that 
the data entered into the system was accurate and consistent. This involved defining multiple constraints for different 
fields, such as name, NRIC, phone numbers, and email formats.
3. **Ensure OOP Principles**: The team had to ensure that the codebase followed object-oriented programming principles to
maintain code quality and readability. This involved designing classes with clear responsibilities, encapsulating data, and
implementing inheritance and polymorphism where necessary.
4. **Testing**: Writing comprehensive unit tests and integration tests to validate the functionality of the application was
a challenging task. The team had to ensure that the tests covered all possible scenarios and edge cases to catch any bugs
or issues in the development process.
5. **Time Management**: Managing the project timeline and ensuring that all tasks were completed on time was a significant
challenge. The team had to prioritize tasks, allocate resources effectively, and coordinate efforts to meet the project
deadlines.

### Achievements from the Project
Despite the challenges faced, the team was able to successfully develop **AcademyAssist** and deliver a functional product
through effective collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. Some of the key achievements from the project include:
1. **Functional Product**: The team was able to develop a fully functional tuition center management application that
incorporated the features and requirements specified in the project brief.
2. **Collaboration**: The team worked well together, leveraging each member's strengths and skills to contribute to the
project's success. Regular meetings, discussions, and feedback sessions helped to keep the project on track and ensure that
everyone was aligned on the goals and objectives.
3. **Learning and Growth**: The project provided an opportunity for team members to develop a functional application from
an existing codebase (AB3), enhancing their programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork. 


### Conclusion
Overall, the development of **AcademyAssist** was a challenging but rewarding experience for our team. The project allowed
us to apply our Java programming skills in a real-world context, collaborate effectively with team members, and deliver a
functional product that met the requirements of the project brief. We learned valuable through the project, and we are proud
of the work we have accomplished together.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancement**
Team size: 5

1. **Allowing more subjects to be added with the addsubject feature:** Currently, Subjects are implemented using an enum with a list of common subjects offered by tuition centers in Singapore. 
Acknowledging that there might be niche subjects not included, we plan to enhance this feature to allow administrators to 
define verified subjects in the system that are offered under the tuition center, such that they can enrol students into 
those subjects as well without losing the benefit of validation and duplication checks. 

2. **Enhance Subject Tracking with list sorted alphabetically or by enrolment:** Currently, the subject list shown when using the subject tracking feature is not sorted. We plan to include the options
to sort by alphabetical order or by enrolment numbers in the future to support easier accessing and allocation of resources.

3. **Enhance UI for scrolling and viewing:** Currently, the UI (e.g. scrollbar) can experience some errors when the app first launches, 
and pop-up windows may require users to manually resize in order to view all the data. In the future, we plan to improve the UI responsiveness 
to work across various window sizes and different computer settings. 

4. **Allowing additional special characters in names:** Currently, only the special characters (-/') are allowed in names. In the future, we plan to improve our validation checks 
to include more special characters such as '.' and ',', and allowing names to end with some of the special characters (e.g. Robert Downey Jr.). 

5. **Accepting consecutive spaces in names:** Currently, consecutive spaces in names are not allowed. We plan to improve the validation checks of names to treat  
multiple spaces in names, which arise likely due to mistakes in entry, as just one space (e.g. treating Jane     Tan as Jane Tan). 

6. **Improved verification of address:** Currently, any String is accepted as an address. In the future, we plan to improve the verification of the address field of 
the add functionality, such that we can check that necessary fields are present, e.g. post code, country, street name etc., 
to ensure that addresses saved are valid addresses.

7. **Allowing Help window to be closed by keyboard shortcut:** Currently, the help window can only be closed by clicking on 
the cross on the window. To improve convenience to the user, we plan to enable the help window to be closed by a keyboard shortcut 
in the future. 

8. **Automatically refresh tracksubject window:** Currently, whenever the user uses a command such as filter or find that 
changes the student contacts listed, the user has to manually run the tracksubject command again to view updated enrolment 
data according to the newly filtered student list. In the future, we plan to enhance the tracksubject method such that 
the enrolment data will be refreshed automatically whenever the student list is changed. 

9. **Display more information on a student's contact:** Currently, only a few fields of a student's contact is displayed 
to keep the information concise and ensure ease of navigation. Although there is a workaround method (detail) provided to 
let users view the full student details, we plan to improve the UI to include more essential information such as NRIC or student photo better 
to reduce ambiguity when navigating through the contact lists.

10. **Make the error message of commands more specific:** Currently, when the user enters commands 
with a StudentID that has an invalid format, the error message is too general. We plan to make it more specific by making it clearer  
to the user that the failed execution was due to an error in the StudentID, and state what the expected format should be. This can help to reduce 
ambiguity and help with troubleshooting.
