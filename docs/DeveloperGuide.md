## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the app.

Given below is an overview of the main components and their interactions.

**Main components of the architecture**

- **`Main`**: This component consists of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It handles the launch and shutdown of the app.
    - At app launch, it initializes other components in the correct sequence and connects them.
    - At shutdown, it triggers cleanup operations for other components.

- **Core Components**:
    - **[UI](#ui-component)**: Provides the graphical interface and command line interface for user interactions.
    - **[Logic](#logic-component)**: Responsible for parsing and executing commands.
    - **[Model](#model-component)**: Manages the application data and state.
    - **[Storage](#storage-component)**: Handles data storage and retrieval.

- **Commons**: A set of utility classes used by multiple components.

**Component Interactions**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows the interactions among components for the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each main component defines its API through an interface, with a `Manager` class implementing each API.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements it in the `LogicManager.java` class. Other components interact with a component via its interface to reduce coupling with specific implementations.

The sections below provide more details of each component.

### UI Component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java).

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of multiple components, including the `MainWindow`, `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CompanyListPanel`, and `StatusBarFooter`. Each of these components inherits from `UiPart`.

- The `UI` component interacts with `Logic` to execute user commands.
- It also listens for changes in the `Model` to update the UI accordingly.
- The UI component is built using JavaFX, and layout files are stored as `.fxml` files in the `view` directory.

### Logic Component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The following sequence diagram demonstrates interactions within `Logic` when executing `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to delete a company).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g., during testing.

### Model Component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Company` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCompanyList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Company` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Company>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Company` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Company` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600" />

</box>


### Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F10-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### TagBuilder Class

The `TagBuilder` class acts as a single entry point for creating different types of tags based on user input. It ensures backward compatibility by maintaining a centralized `build` method for tag creation. This approach allows for:
- **Backward Compatibility**: The `TagBuilder` preserves the original design where tags were treated as a single entity with one entry point.
- **Extensibility**: New specialized tags can be introduced without modifying the other parts of the codebase's logic, as all tag creation logic is encapsulated in `TagBuilder`.
- **Centralized Logic**: The logic to determine tag types (e.g., `DifficultyTag`, `SalaryTag`, etc.) based on user inputs is managed in one place, making the code more maintainable. This is particularly useful
    in our CLI app where the user inputs could be anything where tag types are determined during run time.

Below is a sample sequence diagram

<puml src="diagrams/TagBuilder.puml" width="600" />


---

Each feature is implemented with careful consideration of compatibility and extensibility, allowing the codebase to evolve while supporting existing functionality.


**[Developer Notes]** For a more complete integration with the User Guide commands and example use cases, developers may wish to review the parsing logic in `XYZCommandParser` classes, specifically how tags and parameters are handled. This includes cases for special tags (e.g., `t/salary_HIGH`, `t/wlb_MEDIUM`), as outlined in the User Guide.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level

The project was moderately challenging due to the complexity of working on an already existing codebase. Extending from AB3, our project consists of more functionalities which proved to be tougher to integrate together due to the increased complexity of the data model and interactions

### Challenges Faced

1. **Understanding complex codebase**: Given that this was a brownfield project, it posed a significant challenge to understand the existing codebase before we could proceed with adding the new features.
2. **Testing**: It was not easy to implement new features as doing so would cause existing tests to fail sometimes.
3. **Designing the user interface**: There was a need to ensure that the features we implemented integrated smoothly with the JavaFX UI components.

### Effort Required

The following areas required significant effort in the project:

1. **Familiarizing with existing codebase**: It was crucial to understand how the initial developers worked on AB3 in order to ensure that the features we implement will work in tandem with the existing functionalities.
2. **Documentation**: There was a need to produce comprehensive documentations for both developers to explain how the application functioned internally, and a user guide to explain to users on how to use the application in its intended way.
3. **Testing**: There was a need to write tests to sufficiently cover the code that we have written to minimise the chances of bugs.

### Achievements

We managed to develop an application that achieves the goal of our project. The application is well-suited for its purpose of keeping track of companies and provides a user-friendly interface. The tests that was written have also allowed us to minimise the number of bugs, ensuring that any invalid inputs is handled in an appropriate manner.

### Reuse and Effort Savings

There were some efforts that was saved by reusing parts from the existing AB3 codebase.

1. **UI Components**: The existing AB3 user interface aligned with our goals, and most of it was retained. Only slight modifications were made to include the UI of new features.
2. **Command Parsers**: Our team adapted the existing parsing logic from AB3 to handle the additional commands that we added to the project.

The reuse of these parts helped us to save time and focus more on refining the new features that we decided to implement. Overall, approximately 15% of the total effort was saved.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Standardise how different fields can be modified**: Currently, fields like `Remark` and `ApplicationStatus` have their own commands to change these fields (`remark` and `status` respectively). We plan to combine this functionality under this `edit` command to provide users with a more seamless experience.
2. **Enhancing the use of URLs**: Currently, the `careerPageUrl` field takes in any values and users are not able to click on them to go to the specified link or copy the URL from the application. We plan to enhance the application to only accept valid URL values and give them a way to easily open up the links from the application.
3. **Improving how names are handled**: Currently, the `name` of a company only accepts alphanumeric values. Also, additional whitespaces in names are not handled with the idea of human error in mind. For example, `Company 1` and `Company  1` will be listed as two different companies even though the latter could be caused by an accidental extra whitespace. We plan to make names include more than just alphanumeric characters as well as collapsing any additional whitespace into a single whitespace.
4. **Standardise the parameters of `add` command**: Currently, `add` command makes `r/` a mandatory prefix even though the value of the remark can be blank. We plan to make this prefix optional to improve user experience by omitting the `r/` prefix when users do not wish to add in a remark.
5. **Improving when the application switches view**: Currently, after using the `edit` command, the application switches back to the default list of all contacts. This can prove to be disruptive for users. We plan to enhance the application by making it stay on the current view that the users are at when using the command.
