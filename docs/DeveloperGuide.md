## **Acknowledgements**

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the  [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)., whose resources and documentation provided a valuable foundation. We would like to express our gratitude to the SE-EDU team and contributors for their well-designed framework, which facilitated our extensions and customizations, allowing us to build on a robust foundation.

We would also like to acknowledge the inspiration we received from other teams during the development of this project:
1.	Team KonTacts (T11-2):
We drew inspiration from their User Guide, particularly their use of icons and boxes for styling. While we did not reuse any code, their design influenced the way we structured our own User Guide.
2.	Team Financial Assurance Revolutionary Telemarketer (F14b-4):
Our implementation of the confirmation window was inspired by a specific [commit](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14b-4/tp/commit/de8ef71a6e48fc2fce6bd93d3b12ec45c7623b02) in their project. We developed our own implementation and further refined it during v1.5 (Week 12) after learning about additional design patterns.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.
* provides confirmation prompts to some classes in `Logic` component for user approval.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Ui` to show an alert dialog and obtain confirmation from user.
4. When user confirms the action (selects "OK"), the command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a patient).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
5. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

The following activity diagram details the step-by-step workflow of the FilterCommand, from receiving filter input to returning filtered results.

<puml src="diagrams/FilterActivityDiagram.puml" width="600"/>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)




### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Administrative staff at a GP clinic responsible for patient management.
* should be apt with technology and trained to be familiar with the software as their primary job

**Value proposition**:
Patient / Contact management systems might be outdated in GP clinics, introducing MediContact might improve user-friendliness.
MediContact also centralizes the details of patients at the clinic with a command line interface to enable efficient contact between patient and clinic.
Furthermore, it can provide easy categorisation and filtering of patients.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level
The project was moderately challenging due to the complexity of managing multiple entity types and integrating various functionalities. Unlike AB3, which deals with a single entity type (Person), our project handles multiple entities such as Appointments, and Notes, increasing the complexity of the data model and interactions.

### Challenges Faced
1. **Data Management**: Handling multiple entity types required a robust data model and efficient data handling mechanisms.
2. **User Interface**: Designing a user-friendly interface that integrates seamlessly with the underlying logic and data models.
3. **Integration with JavaFX**: Ensuring smooth integration with JavaFX for the UI components, especially given the non-modular setup.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the application performs efficiently with a large dataset (up to 1000 contacts) without noticeable sluggishness.
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing to ensure all functionalities work as expected and the application is robust against invalid inputs.
6. **Complex Codebase**: Starting from a brownfield project meant working with a complex, pre-existing codebase. Understanding and adapting to others' coding styles and logic added a significant challenge, requiring time and careful analysis to ensure seamless integration of new features.

### Effort Required
The project required significant effort in the following areas:
1. **Familiarizing with existing code**: Understanding and adapting to others' coding styles and logic added a significant challenge, requiring time and careful analysis to ensure seamless integration of new features.
2. **Design and Architecture**: Planning the architecture to handle multiple entities and their interactions.
2. **Implementation**: Coding the functionalities, ensuring they work together seamlessly.
3. **Testing**: Writing and executing test cases to ensure the application is bug-free and performs well.
4. **Documentation**: Producing comprehensive documentation for both developers and users, including a developer guide to explain the system's components and a user guide to ensure understanding of the application's features.

### Achievements
1. **Robust Data Model**: Successfully designed and implemented a data model that handles multiple entity types efficiently.
2. **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed a user-friendly interface that integrates well with the underlying logic.
3. **Performance**: Optimized the application to handle large datasets without performance issues.
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Ensured the application is robust and handles invalid inputs gracefully.

### Reuse and Effort Savings
A significant part of the effort was saved through the reuse of components from the AB3 project:
1. **UI Components**: Reused and adapted UI components from AB3, saving time on designing and implementing new UI elements.
2. **Command Parsing**: Leveraged the command parsing logic from AB3, adapting it to handle the additional commands required for our project.
3. **Storage**: Utilized the storage mechanisms from AB3, modifying them to handle the additional data types.<br>
4. **Architecture Design**: Built upon the existing architecture design from AB3, extending classes on top of the current structure.

The reuse of these components allowed us to focus more on the unique aspects of our project, such as handling multiple entity types and optimizing performance, thereby saving approximately 20% of the total effort.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Team size: 5

1. **Improve handling of name inputs (`add` and `edit` commands)**: Currently names accepted are only alphanumeric. 
To improve inclusivity, we plan to accept special characters (e.g. "s/o", "d/o"), accents (e.g. Ã©, Ã¨) as well as other
languages. However, we will restrict names from including numbers, due to their lack of use.<br><br>
An example of a newly accepted command will be:`edit Javier n/JaviÃ©r`<br><br>
An example of a command that will trigger an invalid error will be: `edit Javier n/J4vier`<br>

2. **Improve our date package (Used by all commands that require a date)**: Currently, it is possible to input invalid
dates such as `29/02/2025 1200` (Invalid leap year) or `31/06/2025 2400` (31st of June does not exist). With our intended
improvement, an error message will be displayed if any instance of an invalid date is inputted.<br><br>
A few examples of commands that will throw invalid date errors will be:<br>
`edit Javier ap/31/06/2025 2400`<br>
`filter ap/31/06/2025 - 29/02/2026`<br>

3. **Introduce stricter constraints for `age`**: Currently our Age field accepts any value ranging from 0-999, which seems
a tad too high. We plan to decrease the upper limit of the range to a more reasonable 150<br><br>
An example of a command that will trigger invalid date errors will be:`edit Javier b/151`<br>

4. **Set age boundaries for `filter age`**: Currently, the `filter` command allows any age range to be inputted, which 
can lead to invalid or nonsensical ranges. We plan to set boundaries for the age filter to ensure that only valid age 
ranges are accepted. The valid age range will be from 0 to 150. We will also check for string length to prevent any 
overflow issues.<br><br>
An example of a command that will trigger an invalid age range error will be: `filter b/151-200`

5. **Introduce verification of phone numbers**: Currently, the application does not properly 
verify the format of phone numbers and email addresses. We plan to introduce validation checks to ensure that phone 
numbers exists.<br><br>
An examples of an invalid input that will trigger an error: `edit Javier p/00000000` (phone number should exist)<br>

6. **Introduce verification of emails**: Currently, the application does not properly verify the format email addresses 
as invalid emails such as `example@example` are still accepted, which is missing the TLD portion of the email. We plan 
to improve validation checks to ensure that email addresses are in the correct format.<br><br>
An examples of an invalid input that will trigger an error: `edit Javier e/example@example` (should follow the format `local-part@domain.tld`)<br>

7. **View any patientâ€™s note without needing to return to the patient list view**: Currently, to view the details or 
notes of a different patient after viewing a specific patient, users must first input the list command to return to the 
full patient list before specifying another patient (e.g. `view SECONDPATIENT`).<br><br>
The enhanced view command will allow the user to switch directly to another patientâ€™s information without the need to 
re-list all patients first.

8. **Introduce stricter constraints for `sex`**: Currently, we accept any alphanumerical input. However, this may not be reflective of 
real-life behavior, despite the freedom it provides the user. Therefore, we plan to restrict the input for the sex field 
to predefined values such as "Male", "Female", and "Other".<br><br>
An example of a command that will trigger an invalid sex error will be: `edit Javier s/Unknown`

9. **Improve UI experience for users**: Currently, the UI may not be as user-friendly as desired. We plan to enhance the 
UI to provide a better user experience. This includes making the UI more responsive, improving the layout, and adding 
visual cues to guide users.<br><br>
Examples of improvements:<br>
**Responsive Design**: Ensure the UI adapts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across 
monitors of different sizes and ensure that there are no text cut-offs for any font size or style used.<br>
**Improved Layout**: Organize the UI elements more logically, making it easier for users to find and use features.<br>
**Visual Cues**: Add star icons for starred contacts, and other visual indicators to help users understand the functionality of different UI elements.

10. **Introduce more detailed error messages**: Currently, the error messages may not provide enough information to help 
users understand what went wrong and how to fix it. We plan to enhance the error messages to be more descriptive and 
helpful.<br><br>
An example of an improvement will be: **Invalid Date**<br>
Current: `Invalid date!`<br>
Improved: `Invalid date! The date '31/06/2025' is invalid because June has only 30 days. Please use the format dd/mm/yyyy. Example: 30/06/2025`
