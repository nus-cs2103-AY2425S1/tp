## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `HiredFiredProParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `HiredFiredProParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `HiredFiredProParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the hiredfiredpro data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `HiredFiredPro`, which `Person` references. This allows `HiredFiredPro` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both HiredFiredPro data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `HiredFiredProStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.hiredfiredpro.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedHiredFiredPro`. It extends `HiredFiredPro` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `hiredFiredProStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedHiredFiredPro#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current hiredfiredpro state in its history.
* `VersionedHiredFiredPro#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous hiredfiredpro state from its history.
* `VersionedHiredFiredPro#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone hiredfiredpro state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitHiredFiredPro()`, `Model#undoHiredFiredPro()` and `Model#redoHiredFiredPro()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedHiredFiredPro` will be initialized with the initial hiredfiredpro state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single hiredfiredpro state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the hiredfiredpro. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitHiredFiredPro()`, causing the modified state of the hiredfiredpro after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `hiredFiredProStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted hiredfiredpro state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitHiredFiredPro()`, causing another modified hiredfiredpro state to be saved into the `hiredFiredProStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitHiredFiredPro()`, so the hiredfiredpro state will not be saved into the `hiredFiredProStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoHiredFiredPro()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous hiredfiredpro state, and restores the hiredfiredpro to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial HiredFiredPro state, then there are no previous HiredFiredPro states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoHiredFiredPro()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoHiredFiredPro()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the hiredfiredpro to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `hiredFiredProStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest hiredfiredpro state, then there are no undone HiredFiredPro states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoHiredFiredPro()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the hiredfiredpro, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitHiredFiredPro()`, `Model#undoHiredFiredPro()` or `Model#redoHiredFiredPro()`. Thus, the `hiredFiredProStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitHiredFiredPro()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `hiredFiredProStateList`, all hiredfiredpro states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire hiredfiredpro.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Viewing Candidates

   1. Viewing a candidate while all candidates are being shown

      1. Prerequisites: List all candidates using the `list` command. Multiple candidates in the list. 

      1. Test case: `view n/Adib j/Developer`<br>
         Expected: Candidate with their details will be shown on the display panel.

      1. Test case: `view n/Adib`, `...` (missing compulsory fields)<br>
         Expected: No candidate displayed on display panel. Error details shown in the result panel.

   1. Viewing a candidate while no candidates are being shown

       1. Prerequisites: List all candidates using the `find xxx` where xxx is a name not existing in current candidates list. Multiple candidates existing.

       1. Test case: `view n/Adib j/Developer`<br>
          Expected: No candidate displayed on display panel. Error details shown in the result panel.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size : 5

  1. Add support for international phone numbers: To accommodate candidates from various countries, 
     we plan to enhance the phone number input field to include area codes (e.g., +6598765432). 
     This update will allow for different international formats and enable the field to accept alphanumeric characters in the future.

  2. Improve name field validation: To ensure accuracy, the name field will be enhanced to prevent the entry of numerical characters, 
     allowing only alphabetic characters. (e.g. "John Doe 1" will not be accepted as a valid name entry)

  3. Enhance find command to take job and skills as parameters: Users are only able to search for candidates by name currently. 
     We plan to allow users to search by job title and skills, making it easier to locate candidates with specific job positions
     and skills.

  4. Enhance the view/hire/reject command such that it can also use indexing: We plan to make the view/hire/reject command format 
     much simpler by adopting a similar command format from the delete command where indexing was used instead of having 
     to input both the candidate's name and the job position.(e.g. "view 1" instead of "view n/John Doe j/Software Engineer)

  5. Enhanced error messages: Some commands give a general error message even when there are multiple type of invalid inputs.
     As such, we will provide more specific error messages across the platform, guiding users with clear, actionable feedback when 
     inputs are incorrect or incomplete. This will improve usability and reduce the likelihood of repeated errors.

  6. Enhanced Command Line Input: Based on user feedback, we will improve the command line input to automatically clear after each command execution. 
     This enhancement will provide a smoother user experience by eliminating the need for manual clearing and ensuring the input field is ready for the 
     next command.

  7. Improve job field validation: Jobs names in the real world typically would not have numbers in them. Most, including the ones in our sample
     data are alphabetical. Thus, to match reality, we will allow only alphabetic characters in the job field. (e.g "Software Engineer 1" will not
     be accepted as a valid job entry)

  8. Enhance sort command: We recognise that hiring managers may not always want to sort based on interview scores. To give more
     versatility to the sort command, we plan to enhance sort command to be able to sort based on alphabetical order based on the 
     candidates' names or candidates' jobs, in addition to its current functionality.
