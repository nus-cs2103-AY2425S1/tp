### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow` and `ContactDisplay`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 1. Student Command

The student command in AdmiNUS is used to add a new student entry to the list of contacts. This command requires specific attributes such as student ID, name, phone number, email, address, and optional tags. The system will validate each input and check for duplicate entries to prevent the addition of a student with identical details.

#### Current Implementation

This is a high-level view of what occurs when the `student` command is executed:

<img src="./images/StudentCommandSequenceDiagram.png">

Student command performs the following checks in order:

- **Flag Validation**: Ensures all mandatory flags (e.g., name, student ID, phone, email, address) are present, and no invalid flags are included.
- **Value Validation**: Confirms that each provided value for specified flags adheres to the expected format.
- **Duplicate Check**: Verifies that no existing student has the same student id.

### 2. Company Command

The `company` command is used to add a new company contact into the list. This command requires attributes such as the company name, phone number, email, address, industry, and optional tags. Similar to the student command, the system validates each input and checks for duplicates to ensure unique entries.

#### Current Implementation

This is a high-level view of what occurs when the `company` command is executed:

<img src="./images/CompanyCommandSequenceDiagram.png">

Company command performs the following checks in order:

- **Flag Validation**: Ensures all mandatory flags (e.g., name, phone, email, address, industry) are present, and no invalid flags are used.
- **Value Validation**: Confirms that each provided value for specified flags meets the required format.
- **Duplicate Check**: Verifies that no existing company has the same combination of name and industry

The following diagrams provides a high-level view of the logic flow for both `student` and `company` command:

<img src="./images/StudentCompanyCommandActivityDiagram-Add_Student_Company_Activity_Diagram.png">

_Note: The error messages will vary depending on which check fails._

### 3. View Command

The `view` command is used to view a specific contact on the contact display pane. To execute the command, users specify the `INDEX` of the contact to be viewed.

#### Current Implementation

Here's an overview of what happens when the `view 1` command is being input by the user:
![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)
The activity diagram is as follows:
![ViewActivityDiagram](images/ViewActivityDiagram.png)

**The View Command checks:**

- that the specified index is positive and within the bounds of the contacts list.

### 4. Find Command

The `find` command is used to find contacts whose name match the specified keyword given by the user.

#### Current Implementation

To execute the `find` command, users must enter a valid `KEYWORD` parameter, by ensuring that the `KEYWORD` parameter is not empty.

The sequence diagram below shows a high-level view of how the `find` operation works when the user inputs `find bob`.

<img src="images/FindSequenceDiagram.png" width="750" />

The activity diagram below shows the flow of the `find` operation.

<img src="images/FindActivityDiagram.png" width="750" />

### 5. Filtertag Command

The `filtertag` command is used to find contacts whose tags are the same as the specified keyword.

#### Current Implementation

To execute the `filtertag` command, users must enter a valid `KEYWORD` parameter, by ensuring that the `KEYWORD` parameter is not empty.

This is a high-level view of what occurs when user inputs `filtertag tagName`.

<img src="images/FiltertagSequenceDiagram.png"/>

### 6. Import Command

The `import` command allows you to bring data from a CSV file into the application, enabling seamless population of your contacts database from external sources.

#### Current Implementation

To execute the `import` command, users must enter a valid `FILE_PATH` parameter, by ensuring that the `FILE_PATH` parameter is not empty, is a valid file path and the file format is `.csv`.

The activity diagram below shows the flow of the `import` operation.

<img src="images/ImportActivityDiagram.png"/>


### 7. Track Command

The `track` command is used to track and display contacts by predefined categories such as `student` or `company`, to effectively manage the visibility of different groups of contacts.

#### Current Implementation
Here is a high-level view of the logic flow when the `track` command is executed:
![TrackActivityDiagram](images/TrackActivityDiagram.png)

The track command performs the following checks:
- Category is present, not consisting of multiple words, and is from the predefined categories (`student` or `company`).
- Contact list is non-empty for the command to be executable.

_Note: The error messages will vary depending on which check fails, to ensure users receive clear feedback._

## Planned Enhancements

Group size: 5

### 1. Disallow Duplicate Phone Numbers Across Contacts

#### Current Issue:

Currently, the app allows users to add multiple contacts (both students and companies) with the same phone number. This can lead to potential confusion or data inconsistency, as users may unintentionally add duplicate contacts with identical phone numbers. In real-world scenarios, it is highly unlikely that two different individuals or entities would share the same phone number, making this behavior unnecessary and potentially misleading.

#### Proposed Enhancement:

Implement a restriction that prevents users from adding new contacts with phone numbers that already exist in the app. This restriction will apply to both student and company contacts, ensuring that each phone number is unique within the contact list. This change aims to enhance data integrity and user experience by reducing redundancy and aligning with real-world expectations where phone numbers are unique identifiers.

### 2. Consistent Case-Insensitive Tag Handling

#### Current Issue:

The current tag handling system in the app is inconsistent regarding case sensitivity across different commands. For example, when adding or deleting contacts, the `t/[TAG]` parameter is case-sensitive, meaning Paid and paid would be treated as separate tags. However, the `tag` command treats tags as case-insensitive, so attempting to add `paid` to a contact that already has the tag `Paid` will result in no action, as it recognises `paid` and `Paid` as the same tag. This inconsistency can lead to user confusion, as the system does not follow a unified approach to case sensitivity.

#### Proposed Enhancement:

Standardise the tag handling logic to be case-insensitive across all commands. This means that tags with the same letters but different capitalisations (e.g., `OwesMoney`, `owesmOney`, `OWESMONEY`) will be treated as identical tags in all scenarios, including adding contacts, adding tags, deleting tags and filtering tags. By making this adjustment, the program will align with standard user expectations of case-insensitivity, creating a more intuitive and consistent experience for users.

### 3. Modify Industry Field to be Case-Insensitive

#### Current Issue:

The industry field is treated as case-sensitive when adding or editing company contacts. This means that "Technology" and "technology" would be stored as separate entries in the backend, even though they are visually identical in the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Such discrepancies can lead to data inconsistencies, making it challenging for users to accurately filter or search for contacts, particularly when multiple capitalization variants exist.

#### Proposed Enhancement:

Modify the industry field to be case-insensitive to ensure consistency across all entries. By treating entries such as "Technology" and "technology" as identical, this enhancement will help prevent unnecessary duplication and reduce confusion. The goal is to provide a consistent user experience by aligning both backend data handling and the GUI representation.

### 4. Handling Prefix Collision in All Input Fields:

#### Current Issue:

Currently, AdmiNUS misinterprets certain content in input fields if it resembles reserved command prefixes (e.g., `t/`, `n/`, `a/`). When users include such prefixes in fields like the address or name, AdmiNUS mistakes them for actual command parameters, which leads to parsing errors and prevents successful command execution. For example, adding an address with `t/` in it (`"311 Clementi Ave 2, t/2, #2-25"`) results in AdmiNUS attempting to parse it as a tag field, which is not intended. This issue affects any field where the input might incidentally include a reserved prefix.

#### Proposed Enhancement:

Implement an improved parsing mechanism that can intelligently differentiate between actual command prefixes and input data that coincidentally contains these prefixes. The proposed enhancement will apply to all input fields (e.g., name, address, email, etc.), ensuring that users can enter data without encountering errors related to command prefix misinterpretation. By enhancing how prefixes are handled in user inputs, this change will allow for more flexible and user-friendly data entry, eliminating errors when prefixes appear naturally in input text.

### 5. Specify `t/` Prefix for Tag Inputs in `filtertag`

#### Current Issue: 

Currently, the `filtertag` command does not require a specific prefix for tag inputs, which can cause ambiguity or lead to misinterpretation of user input.Example: `filtertag friends` Users may inadvertently enter invalid data without realizing they did not need to specify tags explicitly, which can result in errors or unintended command behavior.

#### Proposed Enhancement: 

Introduce the t/ prefix for tag inputs in the `filtertag` command, requiring users to specify tags as t/<tag>. Example: `filtertag t/friends`. This enhancement clarifies user intent by indicating that they are filtering by a specific tag and aligns with other command syntax patterns that use prefixes for inputs. The t/ prefix will improve command consistency and reduce input errors, resulting in a more user-friendly experience.

### 6. More Specific Error Messages for Corrupted CSV Files in `import`

#### Current Issue: 

The current error message for CSV file corruption in the `import` command is generic, providing minimal detail about the specific problem (e.g., missing fields or incorrect formatting). This lack of specificity may lead to user confusion, as they may be unsure of what exactly needs to be corrected in the CSV file to successfully import data.

#### Proposed Enhancement: 

Enhance the error message to specify which fields are missing or incorrectly formatted. For example, `“Error: Missing compulsory field ‘name’ in row 3”` or `“Invalid category in row 5; expected ‘student’ or ‘company’”`. By providing more precise feedback on CSV formatting issues, users will be better equipped to correct their files quickly, minimizing trial and error and streamlining the import process. This enhancement will improve user experience by making error messages actionable and informative.

### 7. Make Error Message for `view` Command More Specific

#### Current Issue:

The format for `view` command is `view INDEX`. The valid input for `INDEX` is a positive integer. The current error message to handle a non-integer input is `"Index must be a positive number!"`, which is too general. For example, if `view 3.5` is being input, the user will be confused as `3.5` is a positive number.

#### Proposed Enhancement:

We plan to change the error message into `"Index must be a positive integer!"`.

### 8. Allow `deletetag all` Command to Handle an Empty List

#### Current Issue:

If the user manages to end up with an empty list, by entering the input `clear` for example, followed by the command `deletetag all t/TAG`, the user is shown a message `Deleted the tags TAG from all contacts in the list`, even though this did not actually happen. This could bring confusion to users.

#### Proposed Enhancement:

Instead, we plan to show an error message whenever the user tries to use the `deletetag all` command on an empty list. The error message will be similar to `Cannot delete tags from an empty list!`. This will give the user a clear idea and bring less confusion.

### 9. Restrict Phone Number Field to 8 Numbers

#### Current Issue:

Currently, the phone number field accepts inputs as long as they are numbers and at least 3 digits long. However, given that our target audience is NUS club administrators, it would be appropriate for phone numbers to have at least 8 digits.

#### Proposed Enhancement:

Perform input check for phone numbers to at least make sure it has 8 digits.

### 10. Improve Error Priority for `edit` Command

#### Current Issue:

When attempting to edit fields restricted to specific contact types (such as `STUDENT_ID` and `INDUSTRY`), the application currently prioritises validating the input format before checking if the field is editable for the specified contact type. This results in a situation where users are first prompted to correct the format, even if they should ultimately be informed that the field cannot be edited for that contact type. For example, attempting to edit a student’s `INDUSTRY` field will first trigger a format error message rather than directly informing the user that the `INDUSTRY` field cannot be edited for students.

#### Proposed Enhancement:

Adjust the error-checking sequence in the `edit` command to prioritise checks on editability based on contact type before format validation. This means users will receive a direct message if they attempt to edit fields restricted for a contact type (e.g., "Industry field cannot be edited for a student contact"), reducing unnecessary steps and making the error feedback more user-friendly.
