### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [
`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [
`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in
charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete o1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API
  `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [
`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagramUpdated.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PetListPanel`,
`OwnerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart`
class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [
`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [
`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Pet` or `Owner` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [
`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete o1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `PawPatrolParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `PawPatrolParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `PawPatrolParser` returns back as a
  `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [
`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramUpdated.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the PawPatrol data i.e., all `Pet` and `Owner` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePetList` and
`UniqueOwnerList` object respectively).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Pet` or `Owner` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Pet/Owner>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a
  `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `PawPatrol` class, which `Pet` references. This allows the `PawPatrol` class to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Pet` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagramUpdated.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [
`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramUpdated.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both PawPatrol data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
- inherits from both `PawPatrolStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Link/Unlink Feature
#### Current Implementation
The link feature mechanism allows linking of `Owner` to `Pet`. Links can be created and entities to be linked can be determined by implementing the `Linkable` interface. In the current implementation, `LinkCommand` only allows linking of Owners to Pets using the indices as per other commands e.g. `link o1 t/p1 t/p2` would link owner at index 1 to pets at index 1 and 2.

A `LinkCommand` is only executed in its entirety when all `Link`s are non-duplicate and having valid indices. Should any single `Link` fail this criteria, no links will be created.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` components, taking `execute("link o1 t/p1 t/p2")` as an example.

![LinkSequenceDiagram](images/LinkSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Unlinking
The `UnlinkCommand` works similarly, finding the unique ID from the `Linkable` interface and removing the associated `Link` from `Model` instead.

#### Handling of Deletes
When an `Owner` or `Pet` is deleted, all associated `Link`s are deleted from the application.

#### Future Improvements
The `LinkCommand` can be generalized for other entity-entity links. For example, linking health records to pets.

## **Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5
1. **Enhance search functionality**: Users can search for pets and owners based on other attributes. For owners, attributes such as ID, contact number, email and address. For pets, attributes such as species, breed, age, sex and tags.
2. **Improve error messages**: Make them standardized, consistent and clearer.
3. **Improve text validation and formatting**: Make data more consistent such as by removing extra spaces in names. (e.g. the input `john    doe` will be saved as `john doe`)
4. **UI updates**: To fix occasional irregular white lines that appear in output box, wrap text that is currently truncated in the UI and enlarge the output box to remove the gap that appears when using the `list owners` or `list pets` command.
5. **Improve the intuitiveness of command formats**: Commands will be made more intuitive for users. For example, the `link` command would be simpler for users without the use of the `t/` prefix.
6. **Automatically make back-ups of data file**: This will prevent data from being accidentally lost when using the `clear` command. A copy of the JSON file will be made frequently and saved in the user's computer.
7. **Allow multiple pets with similar characteristics**: (exactly the same name, species, breed, age and sex) as long as they are linked to different owners. The user will be prompted to link an existing pet to its owner before a duplicate pet can be added. 
8. **Truncate zeroes at the start of a pet's age**: for single-digit pet ages (01, 02, 03 years) could lead to duplicate entries if another pet exits in the database with all characteristics the same and their age keyed in without a zero at the start (1, 2 or 3 years). Future versions will rectify this behaviour by ignoring the zero if the pet's age is between 0 and 9 years.
9. **Improve link/unlink commands**: When an invalid `link` or `unlink` command is entered, it will specify the exact reason why that command failed. (e.g. a multiple `link` where 1 or more pairs is already linked or doing an `unlink` where 1 or more pairs is missing from the database)
