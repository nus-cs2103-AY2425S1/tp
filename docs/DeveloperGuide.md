### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Command History

#### Implementation

The command history functionality is implemented in three main components:

1. `CommandHistory`: This class maintains a list of past commands and `currentIndex` to track the current position within the list. It includes methods for adding new commands and retrieving the previous or next command:

* `add(command)` — Adds a command to the history and resets the pointer to the most recent position.
* `getPreviousCommand()` — Moves the pointer to the previous command and returns it.
* `getNextCommand()` — Moves the pointer to the next command and returns it.

2. `LogicManager`: The `LogicManager` component integrates the `CommandHistory` to store each command upon execution. It provides access to the history for other components like the UI.


3. `CommandBox` UI Component: This component captures key events when the user presses the up or down arrow keys. Based on these key events, it retrieves commands from `CommandHistory` via `LogicManager` and displays them in the command input field.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates the flow when a user presses the up arrow key to access the previous command in history:

![CommandHistorySequence](images/CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png)

1. The user presses the up arrow key.
2. `CommandBox` calls `LogicManager#getPreviousCommand()`.
3. `LogicManager` delegates this request to `CommandHistory#getPrevious()`.
4. `CommandHistory` retrieves the previous command and returns it to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` then passes the command back to `CommandBox`.
6. `CommandBox` displays the previous command in the input field.

This streamlined structure keeps the history management isolated within CommandHistory, simplifying logic in other components. The result is an intuitive user experience that enhances the command-line interface.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. It also stores a `predicateStateList` for the Predicates used for each state. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `executeCommand` method in the Command class calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `student /name David …​` to add a new person. The `executeCommand` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command indirectly uses `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` which checks if the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command indirectly uses `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` to check if `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `help`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `help`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `student /name David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team Size: 5

1. **Update `student` and `teacher` success message**: The current success message for adding a student or teacher without any tags ends with `; Tags:`, i.e. it attempts to display the tags but since none were added, it ends off abruptly. 

    We plan to make the success message only mention the Tags _if_ there are tags to be listed, e.g. either `... Next of Kin: Bob Doe; Emergency Contact: 87654321;` (i.e. no tags) or `... Next of Kin: Bob Doe; Emergency Contact: 87654321; Tags: [friend]` (i.e. at least one tag to be displayed).
2. **Enhance `mark` command's implementation**: The current implementation of `mark` can only mark the attendance of all students together. This prevents users from easily marking the attendance of individual students. The current workaround is to either `mark` and `unmark` all other students or to `delete` and add the student back into EduConnect with the incremented attendance field. 

    We plan to introduce optional index parameters for the `mark` command, allowing users to specify which indexes to specifically mark the attendance of. This implementation will be similar to the `unmark` command. E.g. `mark` will still mark the attendance of all students but `mark 1 2` will only mark the attendance of the 1st and 2nd index persons (assuming they are students).
3. **Use shorter command aliases**: Currently, EduConnect requires users to use longer parameters such as `/name` when entering commands.

   We plan to introduce shorter command aliases, such as `/n` for `/name`, to make input faster and more convenient for users.
4. **Prevent `edit` command from accepting `/nok`, `/attendance` and `/emergency` prefix for `teacher`**: The current implementation of the `edit` command allows for the use of `/nok`, `/attendance` and `/emergency` prefixes for `teacher` contacts. This is not necessary as these fields are not applicable to teachers. 

    We plan to prevent the use of these prefixes for `teacher` contacts, ensuring that only the relevant fields can be edited for teachers.
5. **Relax restrictions on phone number to allow international phone numbers**: The current implementation of the `add` command restricts phone numbers to be 8 digits long. This is not suitable for international phone numbers, which can be longer than 8 digits. 

    We plan to relax the restrictions on phone numbers to allow for international phone numbers, which can be longer than 8 digits. This will allow for a wider range of phone numbers to be added to EduConnect.
6. **Make `gender` parameter case-insensitive**: The current parameter of `gender` requires the user to input strictly `male` or `female`. This is not user-friendly as users may input `Male` or `Female` instead. 

    We plan to make the `gender` parameter case-insensitive and accept both `male` and `female` and also `m` and `f` in any case as valid inputs to allow for a more user-friendly experience.
7. **Ability to edit attendance for students**: The current `edit` command does not support editing the attendance parameter.

    We plan to enhance the `edit` command to include the ability to directly modify the student's attendance field to a specified value, provided it adheres to the required constraints of the attendance parameter. The command format will be `edit INDEX [/attendance ATTENDANCE]`.
8. **Update `find` command to support partial matching**: The current `find` command only supports exact matches for search parameters, which limits its flexibility.

   We plan to enhance the `find` command to allow partial matches, enabling users to search for entries using incomplete information. For instance, entering `find /name han` would return results such as "Hans Gruber" and "Johanna Smith.".
9. **Prevent duplicate subjects to be added**: The current implementation for adding a contact allows for duplicate subjects to be added for a contact.

    We plan to prevent the addition of duplicate contacts by filtering out subjects that already exist in the contact's subject list.
10. **Allow certain special characters in names**: The current implementation for adding a contact prevents the use of any special characters in names.
    
    We plan to allow the incorporation of characters such as '/' and '-' in names to accommodate a wider range of names. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Appendix: Effort**


The main difficulty faced by the team was understanding the existing codebase and adapting it to meet new requirements. The team had to dedicate a significant amount of time to comprehending the codebase and the interactions between its various components, which was a considerable challenge due to their lack of prior experience with it.
Fortunately, the existing AB3 developer guide provided a solid starting point for tackling the new requirements. By leveraging the guide, the team was able to implement new features, such as abstracting `Person` into `Student` and `Teacher`.
<br><br>
The learning curve associated with JavaFX and implementing the GUI presented another significant challenge for the team. With only basic knowledge gained from their iP projects, the team had to learn JavaFX from scratch, dedicating a substantial amount of time to mastering it and implementing the GUI, which in turn slowed down the development process.
Additionally, making significant changes to the JSON storage file posed another hurdle. The team needed to understand how the JSON storage file functioned and how to modify it without disrupting existing functionality. This was particularly challenging due to the team’s lack of prior experience with JSON storage files, requiring them to learn how to make modifications without causing issues in the current system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
School teachers looking to manage the details of both students and other teachers.
* needs to keep track of many students at a time
