## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete p 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `EventListPanel` `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete p 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object), as well as all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* User is a event organiser / planner
* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

Eventory is an application that allows you to plan events easily, whether you’re planning by yourself or collaborating with others. With Eventory, you’ll keep crucial details always at your fingertips and ensure that everyone is on the same page.

Here are some of the features of Eventory:

* **Add**, **Edit**, and **Delete** contacts and events
* **Find** contacts and events by name and tag
* **Link** contacts to events

By enhancing management and data processing, Eventory reduces stress and helps you execute events smoothly and efficiently.

### User stories
Priorities: High (must have) - `* * *`, Medium (nice to have) - `* *`, Low (unlikely to have) - `*`
#### Important Note:
* Not all features in the user stories have been implemented
* For features that have been implemented, they may not work exactly as described in user stories
* Features are not implemented strictly based on priority

| Priority | As a …​                                          | I want to …​                                               | So that I can…​                                                            |

### Non-Functional Requirements

**1. Domain Rules**
- 1a. `Essential` The number of contacts in a single event should not exceed 1000, ensuring efficient management of contacts for each event.

**2. Technical Requirements**
- 2a. `Essential` Must be compatible with Java 17 or higher, ensuring that the application runs on modern environments.
- 2b. `Typical` The system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments, making it accessible to a broader range of users.

### Requirements yet to be implemented

**1. Keyboard Shortcut for Quick View Switching**
- Currently, the app requires users to rely on GUI mouse clicks to switch between "Contacts" and "Events" views, which slows down navigation in a CLI environment. 
- To improve the efficiency of the interface, a keyboard shortcut or CLI command should be added to allow seamless switching between these views. 
- This will enhance the CLI-friendliness of the app and speed up user navigation.

**2. Automated Communication for Event Contacts**
- Currently, there is no option for users to send messages directly to contacts linked to an event, making communication difficult when managing events. 
- A messaging feature should be implemented to allow users to send bulk messages to all contacts associated with a particular event. 
- Additionally, the feature should support both instant and scheduled messaging, so users can plan communications in advance and keep participants informed easily.

**3. Batch Import and Export for Contacts and Events**
- Currently, the system does not support batch import or export of contacts and events, limiting its scalability for users who need to manage large data sets. 
- A feature should be introduced to allow users to import and export contacts and events using formats like CSV or JSON. 
- This would streamline data management and make it easier for users to transfer large quantities of data between systems.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Project Scope and Difficulty
This project was significantly more demanding than the Address Book 3 (AB3) reference project due to the difficulty of
managing multiple entity types and broader scope. While AB3 focuses on a single entity type (Persons),
Eventory expands upon this through the addition of Events and linking between the two types. This increases the 
difficulty of implementation of features such as deleting due to dependencies between entities, needing a more solid
data model and careful planning surrounding the logic parts of the application.

### Challenges Faced

* **Entity Linking:** Creating relationships between the entities of Contacts and Events through the linking raised
significant issues, especially in maintaining data consistency
* **Testing and Code Coverage:** Maintaining high test coverage in such a highly abstracted and complicated system proved
challenging, adding to the workload of the project
* **Clear Communication:** Maintaining clear communication added to the difficulty of the project due to differences in
perspective, methodologies and context between each team member that could lead to misunderstandings.

### Effort Required
The project required approximately **1.4x** the effort used in AB3, largely due to the aforementioned challenges faced.

### Achievements
In spite of the difficulties, we have successfully done the following:
* Create a scalable and systemic structure that meets the needs of event planning organizations
* Attain a respectable test coverage level for key functionalities
* Implemented an intuitive and user-friendly interface that maintains the fast operation time
* Incorporated new features such as linking and searching by tag name, extending the basic features of AB3

### Reuse and Libraries
This project uses several libraries which supports critical functionality:
1.  **JUnit 5:** Utilised in unit testing, speeding up the efficiency of the testing process, improving code quality
2.  **JavaFX:** Utilised in building the Graphical User Interface (GUI), improving the time taken to implement a user interface

For example, the tests folder uses JUnit 5 heavily to conduct tests. Our work involving tests consists of a significant
part of the workload. By using JUnit 5, we are able to save an estimated **15-20%** of effort and time as compared to building
test classes from scratch.

### Conclusion
The project called for a lot of cooperation and work. Despite this, it results in a robust application
that addresses many issues faced by event planning companies. It reflects the teams strength in being able to deliver
even when there are significant challenges.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team Size: 5**

The following planned enhancements address known feature flaws identified during the PE-D phase. Each enhancement
specifically describes the feature flaw and the proposed solution, providing details on how the feature will be improved.
This section lists 9 planned enhancements, adhering to the team size x 2 limit.

### 1. **Enhance Error Handling**
   1. **Feature Flaw:** Current error messages are generic, with no specifics on the issue.
   2. **Proposed Fix:** Improve the parser to be able to identify specific issues.
   3. **Expected Outcome:** Improved ease of usage for users.

### 2. **Auto-Switch Views After Modifications**
   1. **Feature Flaw:** After adding, editing, or deleting an event or contact, the view does not automatically switch to the relevant tab.
   2. **Proposed Fix:** Implement logic to automatically toggle to the appropriate view after executing an event- or contact-related command.
   3. **Expected Outcome:** Users will have immediate visual feedback after actions, reducing confusion and enhancing workflow.

### 3. **Enhanced Duplicate Handling for Contacts and Events**
1. **Feature Flaw:** Contacts with the same name are flagged as duplicates, even if they have different phone numbers or emails. Similarly, events with the same name are considered duplicates, even if they have different locations or start times.
2. **Proposed Fix:** Allow contacts with the same name to be distinguished by phone number and/or email. For events, allow different locations and/or start times for events with the same name.
3. **Expected Outcome:** This will improve organization by allowing contacts and events with the same name but different details. It will accommodate real-world scenarios more effectively.

### 4. **Case-Insensitive Matching for Names and Tags**
   1. **Feature Flaw:** Names and tags are case-sensitive, leading to issues when searching, adding, or editing entries with different cases.
   2. **Proposed Fix:** Make the handling of names and tags case-insensitive throughout the app.
   3. **Expected Outcome:** Users will have a more intuitive experience, as names and tags will be recognized regardless of letter case, minimizing errors.

### 5. **Simplified Tagging for Multiple Tags**
   1. **Feature Flaw:** Multiple tags require individual tag flags, which is cumbersome.
   2. **Proposed Fix:** Allow users to enter multiple tags with a single flag, separated by spaces (e.g., `t/tag1 tag2 tag3`).
   3. **Expected Outcome:** This will streamline the process of adding multiple tags, enhancing usability and reducing redundant typing.

### 6. **Support for Hyphenated Names**
   1. **Feature Flaw:** Names currently only accept alphanumeric characters and spaces, excluding hyphenated names.
   2. **Proposed Fix:** Update validation to allow hyphens in names, enabling entry of more varied name formats.
   3. **Expected Outcome:** This will accommodate real-world name formats, making the app more versatile for users.

### 7. **Partial Matching for Find and Search**
   1. **Feature Flaw:** The current find and search feature only supports exact word matching for names and tags.
   2. **Proposed Fix:** Extend the find and search functionality to allow partial matching within words (e.g., "sun" for "sundown race").
   3. **Expected Outcome:** This improvement will make find and search results more flexible and relevant, especially for users who may not remember the exact wording.

### 8. **Keyboard short-cut or command to switch between Contacts and Events**
1. **Feature Flaw:** There is no existing way to switch between Contacts and Events using the keyboard.
2. **Proposed Fix:** Implementing a key-bind or command to switch between Contacts and Events.
3. **Expected Outcome:** This improvement will improve usability and user experience.

### 9. **Support for multiple phone numbers, emails and addresses for a Contact**
1. **Feature Flaw:** Contacts are currently limited to 1 phone number, email and address each.
2. **Proposed Fix:** Allow for the storage and use of multiple phone numbers, emails and addresses.
3. **Expected Outcome:** This will accommodate real-world contact details where a person may have multiple phone numbers, emails and addresses.

### 10. **Support for more languages**
1. **Feature Flaw:** The application is developed and tested in English, the use of other languages may result in unintended behaviour or bugs.
2. **Proposed Fix:** Add support for various languages for various commonly used languages in the region.
3. **Expected Outcome:** This improvement will improve usability of Eventory for those who do not have English as a primary language.

These planned enhancements aim to address known issues and improve the overall usability, reliability, and user experience of **Eventory**.
