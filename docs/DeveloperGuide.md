### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

The component **`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EmployeeListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Employee` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete an employee).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Employee` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEmployeeList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Employee` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Employee>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- stores a `CommandTextHistory` object that represents the user's command history.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list and a `Skill` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Employee` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Employee` needing their own `Tag` objects. Likewise, `AddressBook` only requires one `Skill` object per unique skill, instead of each `Employee` needing their own `Skill` objects.<br>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save the address book data, user preference data and command text history in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage` and `CommandTextHistoryStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

## **Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **Improve UI resizing:** Currently, with smaller window sizes (including default size of window on first startup), part of the UI can be cut off. We plan to improve UI dynamic resizing to support more window sizes.
2. **Improve UI design:** The current UI is functional but lacking in aesthetics. We plan to redesign the UI to improve readability and reduce confusion for users.
3. **Clear all assignments feature:** We plan to add a `clearassignments` command which allows users to delete all assignments.
4. **Make sample data more relevant:** Some of the example commands and sample data contain information that are not relevant to human resource management tasks. (For instance, some employees are tagged as 'friends', 'family', etc.) We plan to replace these with more fitting examples.
5. **Allow users to specify other fields in `listprojectmembers`:** Currently, users can only specify project name, but this could result in project members from multiple projects with the same name being shown. We plan to improve this command by allowing users to specify fields such as project ID instead, such as `listprojectmembers pid/1`. Since project IDs uniquely identify a project, users will be able to see only project members from that project specified.
6. **Improved email validation:** Currently, users can enter emails without a top-level domain, such as `example@email`. We plan to validate emails to require that a top-level domain be specified. Thus, emails such as `john@email.com` will be allowed, but `john@email` will not be.
7. **Update UI after `assign`:** Currently, when users execute `listprojectmembers` and then execute `assign`, the Assignments panel may still continue to show the filtered list of assignments. We plan to clear existing filters after each `assign` command, so users can see the full list of assignments.
8. **Allow users to specify both list index or ID for certain commands:** For some commands such as `delete`, the list index (position of the item in display list) is used. However, for other commands such as `assign`, ID is used. For flexibility and to reduce confusion, we plan to let users specify which to use through prefixes (`pid/`, `id/`, `li/`(list index) etc.)
9. **Improve formatting of command success / error messages:** Certain success messages (such as that for the `assign` command) are too long / go off-screen and become hard to read. We plan to format these messages better to increase readability.
10. **Better error message for employee / project / assignment IDs that are too large:** As IDs are currently stored as `int`, storing IDs with too large of a number (e.g. ten digits of '9') leads to overflow. However, the error message only reminds the user they should use numeric IDs. We plan to update the error message to mention the numerical limit to IDs.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the .jar file and store it in an empty folder.

   2. Open a command terminal, use the command `cd [folder path]` to navigate into the folder you put the `.jar` file in, and use the command `java -jar HRConnect.jar` to run the application.
      - Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts, projects, and assignments. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the .jar file.<br>
      - Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting an employee

1. Deleting an employee while all employees are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all employees using the `listemployees` command. Multiple employees in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>

      - Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>

      - Expected: No employee is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      - Expected: Similar to previous.

### Command history

1. Navigating through command history with the up/down arrow keys

   1. Prerequisites: Enter several different commands (e.g., `listemployees`, `addproject pn/Project X pid/3`, `delete 1`), so that there is a history of commands available.

   2. Test case: Press the up arrow key (â†‘) in the command box.
      - Expected: The previous command appears in the command box.
   3. Test case: Press the up arrow key (â†‘) repeatedly to cycle through older commands.
      - Expected: Each press navigates one step back in the command history. The earliest command is reached when pressing the up arrow no longer changes the displayed command.
   4. Test case: Press the down arrow key (â†“) to navigate forward in the command history.

      - Expected: Each press navigates one step forward in the command history. The most recent command is reached when pressing the down arrow change command box back to blank.

   5. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      - Expected: Similar to previous.

2. Persisting command history across sessions

   1. Prerequisites: Ensure there are commands in the history from a previous session.

   2. Close the application and re-launch it by running the .jar file again.

   3. Test case: Press the up arrow key (â†‘) in the command box.
      - Expected: Commands from the previous session(s) appear, allowing navigation through the command history from earlier sessions.

3. Testing command history limits
   1. Enter 50 commands in succession (e.g., `listemployees`, `delete 1`, repeated or varied).
      - Expected: Only the 50 most recent commands are saved. Attempting to access a 51st older command with the up arrow key will not be possible.

### Other commands

1. Using / Testing other commands in HRConnect

   1. Refer to the [User Guide "Features" section](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t15-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#features) for an exhaustive list of commands.
   2. Valid command formats, command examples, parameter limitations, and expected outputs are provided.
   3. Enter the commands with the provided format and parameter limitations.
      - Expected: The output performs the same as the listed expected output.
   4. Enter the commands not following the provided format or violating parameter limitations.
      - An appropriate error message is thrown.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. With the app open or closed, find the data file in the folder you placed the .jar file, as `data/hrconnect.json`.
   2. Delete the file.
   3. If the app is not open, launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.
   4. Create or delete any Employee, Project, or Assignment.
      - Expected: A new data file is created at `data/hrconnect.json` containing the information in the app at the time.

2. Transferring data

   1. Prerequisites: Make some changes to the sample data (so it is different from the default entries, e.g. `addproject`).
   2. Copy the data folder at `data` (including `hrconnect.json` inside) into an empty folder.
   3. Copy the .jar file into this same folder (not into `data`!).
   4. Run the .jar file.
      - Expected: The changes you made are still displayed in the app.

## Appendix: Effort

HRConnect is based on the [AddressBook Level-3 (AB3)](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3) ([UG](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/UserGuide.html), [DG](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html)).

### Challenges and Difficulty

Both AB3 and HRConnect deal with their stored data as entities (`Person` for AB3, `Employee`, `Project` and `Assignment` for HRConnect).

However, HRConnect ended up as a significantly larger project due to the multiple entities involved (instead of only one). HRConnect also ended up more complicated in general due to the interactions between these entities. For instance, Assignment represents a link between an Employee and a Project, and we also had to deal with handling them in case of deletions to Employees or Projects.

Integration was also a challenge at the start, mainly due to some members' unfamiliarity with GitHub and Git. There were a few merge conflicts that we were able to resolve. However, we were able to mitigate much of the pain points by splitting the work up into relatively defined portions.

### Reuse

In the earlier stages of the project, some effort was saved by reusing certain parts of AB3 code. For instance, the code for adding and deleting projects was a heavily modified version of the original AB3 commands.

Due to the increasing size of our project, we have since refactored certain parts (e.g. all three `list` commands) for better code structure.

### Achievements

We had a clear and defined vision of the requirements and features from the start, which helped with executing the implementation (coding) portion of the project.

We are happy to say we were able to match all of our milestones, even the earlier ones.

We were also able to achieve a high level of test coverage for each Pull Request, and our features are confirmed to work well for the average target user so far.
