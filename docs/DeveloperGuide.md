## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuteez/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuteez/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

#### Command Box Component

The `CommandBox` component is responsible for handling user command inputs and managing command history navigation.

**Handling user inputs:**
Below is the sequence diagram illustrating how the `CommandBox` processes user inputs:

<puml src="diagrams/CommandBoxSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for CommandBox command execution"/>

How command execution works:
1. When the user types a command and presses Enter, the `CommandBox` retrieves the command text from the `TextField`.
2. If the command is not empty, it is passed to the `CommandExecutor` for execution.
3. Upon successful execution:
   - The command is added to the `CommandHistory` for tracking previous commands.
   - The text field is cleared.
4. If a `CommandException` or `ParseException` occurs:
   - The error style class is added to the text field to indicate error.
   - The command text will not be added to the `CommandHistory`.

**Command History Navigation:**
Below is the sequence diagram showing the command history navigation:
<puml src="diagrams/CommandBoxSequenceDiagram2.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for CommandBox history navigation"/>

- UP Arrow Key: Retrieves the previous command from the `CommandHistory` when pressed.
- DOWN Arrow Key: Retrieves the next command from the `CommandHistory` when pressed.
- After retrieving a command (previous or next), the `CommandBox` updates the `TextField` with this command and moves the cursor to the end of the text.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuteez/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuteez/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** While TelegramUsername, Email, and Address are optional fields in the application, their multiplicities associated to the `Person` class in the diagram remains `1`. This is implemented through a design pattern where these attributes are represented by non-null wrapper objects that can internally contain null values.

</box>

**API** : [`LessonManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuteez/model/person/lesson/LessonManager.java)

<puml src="diagrams/LessonClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `LessonManager` component,
* stores all the info regarding `Lesson` objects.`LessonManager.dayLessonsMap` is a `HashMap` where keys are `Day`s, intuitively there are only 7 keys in the `HashMap`. One for each day of the week.
* uses a `TreeSet<Lesson>` as value of `LessonManager.dayLessonMap`. A `TreeSet` is used to maintain ordering of lessons. Lessons are ordered according to `Lesson.startTime`
* is the main class that determines any overlapping or clashing lessons for lessons within the memory.

<puml src="diagrams/LessonManagerDetectClashingLessons.puml" width="1000" />

The diagram above shows how clashing lessons are detected,

* `clashingLessonsMap` is a `Map` where each key is a student whose lessons conflict with a newly proposed lesson. The value associated with each key is an array of that student’s specific lessons that clash with the proposed lesson.

<box type="info" seamless>

Note: As of `v1.6` clashing lessons are not allowed, hence when a `Person` is deleted, all of his/her lessons can be safely deleted as well. No other students will have the same lesson time. The team is considering allowing clashing lessons after warning users for a future release.

</box>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F09-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuteez/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)



### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tuteez.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find feature

#### Implementation details

The `find` command involves searching for keywords that match the student's details.

It uses `FindCommandParser` to parse the user input and create a `FindCommand` object, which modifies the `Person` object in the `Model`.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the flow for the `find` command:

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find n/john` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

#### Design Considerations

Aspect: Search target differentiated by prefixes
- Alternative 1 (Current choice): Prefixes (e.g., n/ for name) specify the field within the studet's details to search, followed by the desired search target (e.g. n/Alice)
    - Pros:
        - Allows for more accurate searches
    - Cons
        - Users must remember prefixes
- Alternative 2: No differentiation of search targets
    - Pros:
        - More straightforward to type out
    - Cons:
        - May result in ambiguous commands, leading to incorrect or incomplete searches.


### Display feature

#### Implementation details
The `DisplayCommand` allows users to display a specified student in Tuteez.

It uses `DisplayCommandParser` to parse the user input and create an `DisplayCommand` object, which modifies the `lastViewedPerson` object in the `Model`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions that take place within the `Logic` component when the user executes the `DisplayCommand`, taking `execute("display 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DisplaySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component when a display command is called" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How this feature works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command `display` (i.e., `DisplayCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DisplayCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed.<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it takes several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

### Detection of next lesson

On the left panel, which displays only the most important information, we show each student’s upcoming lesson based on the computer’s current time.

High level idea:

* For each student, calculate the duration remaining until the start of each of their lessons based on devices current time.
* Identify the lesson with the shortest remaining time and display it as their next scheduled lesson.
* Returns null if a student has no lessons scheduled.

How this feature works:

1. Every minute, UI calls `Person#nextLessonBasedOnCurrentTime` on every student to consistently keep track of a students next lesson
1. `Person#nextLessonBasedOnCurrentTime` calls `Lesson#durationTillLesson` for all of student's lessons which returns `Duration` objects
1. Then leverage `Duration#compareTo` to get the lesson with the shortest duration
1. Return lesson with shortest duration or `null` if student has no lessons

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* tech-savvy full-time tuition teacher
* exclusively teach 1-1 tuition (no group lessons)
* Teaches a regular weekly schedule
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Our app serves as an address book tailored for tech-savvy full-time tuition teachers who prefer to use CLI, streamlining the management of student schedules and contact details. It effectively prevents scheduling conflicts and allows for quick access to essential information, enabling teachers to prioritise teaching over administration.

**Note:**

* It is possible that the target user changes or its scope is widened in the future

## **Appendix: Effort**

This project presented a significant challenge due to the complexity and precision required at each development stage. Building a responsive and visually cohesive UI was one of the main hurdles. Ensuring that all elements fit together seamlessly took considerable time and required constant adjustments. Achieving a layout that is both user-friendly and adaptable to different screen sizes was especially challenging, as even minor alignment issues could disrupt the overall flow of the interface.

Implementing specific features, such as displaying the next lesson on the student card, added another layer of difficulty. This feature necessitated setting up a timer that refreshes every minute, which required careful attention to performance so that the app wouldn’t slow down or consume excessive resources. Managing this timer involved designing an efficient refresh mechanism that updates only what’s necessary, minimizing memory use while providing real-time updates.

Handling clashing lesson schedules introduced further complexity. We had to account for numerous edge cases—students with overlapping or consecutive classes. Designing a robust conflict-checking system meant anticipating all potential scheduling scenarios and validating inputs carefully, adding to the development time and requiring extensive testing.

In addition, adding custom features like remarks and lesson tracking posed challenges in both design and functionality. Error handling had to be highly specific and informative, meaning that we could not rely on generic error messages. Each action, whether adding a lesson or a remark, needed unique error handling to guide users effectively without overwhelming them with unnecessary information. Crafting these targeted error messages involved considering possible user errors and ensuring that each message communicated the issue clearly while remaining concise.

The effort invested in this project was substantial, as we went beyond the base features of AB3, adding numerous enhancements and custom functionalities. Specifically, we added a **lessons** feature to track and manage student schedules, developed a system to handle **clashing lessons** and ensure no overlaps, integrated a **remarks** feature for notes on students, and created a **display** command to quickly pull up detailed student information. We overhauled the UI to create a more intuitive and visually appealing interface, which required meticulous attention to design and usability. Additionally, we modified many existing commands in AB3 like add and edit.

We also put significant focus on refining error handling. Every error message was crafted to be clear, informative, and specific to each potential issue, guiding users more effectively through the app. Balancing all these improvements while maintaining a high standard of quality and consistency demanded extensive effort, but it enabled us to deliver a more robust and user-friendly experience.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
Group size: 5 members

1. Student identification: 
   - Our app uniquely identifies students by name. In future updates, we plan to use a combination of name **and** phone number for unique identification.
      - Two students cannot share the same name and the same phone number.
      - Allowing different names with the same phone number accommodates cases where tutors of younger students may store siblings under different names but with a shared contact number, typically a parent’s.
1. Optimise add command:
   - Our app does not support adding remarks while adding new student. 
   - In future updates, we can add this feature to grant our users more flexibility.
1. Optimise edit command:
   - Our app does not support direct editing of lessons or remarks. 
   - In future updates, we plan to enable users to edit existing lessons and remarks without needing to delete and re-add them.
1. Find parameter checking:
   - For name, tag and address keywords, the parser only checks that they are not blank.
   - In future updates, we plan to alert users when the keywords are invalid (ie valid when only contains certain characters).
1. Find command Behavior:
   - After using the find command to locate student(s), executing most other commands will reset the left panel to the default view, as if the `list` command was called. 
   - In future updates, we will rectify this issue.
1. Remark Constraints:
   - We do not allow remarks to contain `r/`. 
   - In future updates, allow `r/`.
1. Find behavior:
   - The find command uses the `or` constraint, while this can provide more flexibility there are cases where users want to search for long sequence of `Strings` such as "Serangoon Gardens Rd".
   - In future updates, we can provide users some way to indicate certain target words as a group and apply `and` constraint.
1. Remarks added one at a time:
   - `addrmk` only allows users to add one remark at a time.
   - In future updates, allow users to add multiple.
1. Remarks deleted one at a time:
   - `delrmk` only allows users to delete one remark at a time.
   - In future updates, allow users to delete multiple.
1. Right panel enhancement:
   - Currently, the right panel automatically scrolls to the top each time the user edits any student details.
   - In the future, we plan to refine this feature so that the panel scrolls directly to the section where the user made edits, providing a more seamless and user-friendly experience.
