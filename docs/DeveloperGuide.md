## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete e 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete e 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete e 1` Command" />

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g. `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g. `DeleteEmployeeCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g. `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g. `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g. `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g. results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level: 10/10

The project was really challenging as we were working on an existing codebase hence to include any implementations, we
would need to know how all the functionalities and classes are connected to one another.

### Challenges Faced:
1. The original AB3 has many different classes that are all coupled together so making a single change would require an
understanding of how the different classes work together, making tracing long codes essential.

2. JavaFX is weirdly restrictive in the things that can be done, such as when it becomes scrollable and no animations
allowed, whereas AB3 seem to have done it seamlessly (except animation) for each component.

3. The way that the frontend pulls data from the backend makes it hard to perform operations on the list.

4. Understanding how AB3 code works from the start to implement our features.

5. The way AB3 handled Person felt like it had a lot of dependency on person. I was in charge of adding new fields to
Person and I had to create the new fields (Department, Role, Contract End Date), update the parser to parse the new
fields, change the JsonAdaptedPerson to convert a json to the new person, update json test cases to have the new fields,
update personBuilder in the testutil to generate new persons, update TypicalPersons to have new persons with department,
role, contract end date and update SampleDataUtil.java to have people with the right sample data. This was extremely
time consuming as just to update Person with new fields you had to update a lot of files with the updated tests.

6. As someone who is inexperienced with Git, there was a very steep learning curve, especially for fixing merge conflicts.

### Effort Required
1. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation was required for all classes and commands to explain every component
for developers as well as for clear standardization.

2. **User Guide**: Crafting a detailed user guide was essential to ensure clear understanding of the usage and purpose of
our application and its features for both technical and non-technical users.

3. **Testing**: Extensive and efficient test cases has to be written and executed to ensure that our application is
bug-free.

4. **Familiarizing with existing codebase**: Careful and thorough analysis of existing codebase is important to ensure
bug-free implementation of new features as well as improving existing ones.

### Achievements
1. **Excellent Product**: Able to produce a well-working application that solves all intended problems and
proposed user stories.

2. **Smooth Performance**: Optimized our code for the application such that it is able to handle large amounts of data
without any performance issues.

### Reuse and Effort Savings
1. **Storage component**
2. **UI components**
2. **Command parsing component**
3. **General feature component**
4. **Architecture Design**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancement**

Team Size: 5

1. Make the scrolling to commands in helpWindow more accurate: The current dropdown jumps to the correct command, but
the command box is not standardized. We plan to make it more accurate ensuring that it jumps to most command boxes with
it at the very top of the helpWindow screen.

2. We will separate potential hires and employees into two different columns in the UI. This makes delete more sensible
as right now, the inclusion of ph or e parameter is not as relevant.

3. We plan to add colours to the help and command output text to improve readability.

4. We will allow users to enter any characters for name in the future. For example, "d/o Jr. à¶žà¶ž" can be inputted in the future.

5. We will allow users to put parameters in address, department and role. For example, "employee n/John Doe p/98765432 
e/johnd@example.com a/311, r/hill Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 d/IT r/SWE ced/2024-10-09" will work where the address is "311, 
r/hill Clementi Ave 2, #02-25"

6. We will allow phone numbers to have symbols such as -#()+ in the future.

7. We will do stricter validation for email to ensure it is a valid domain. For example, "e/alice@gmail" is currently
valid, but it should not be.

8. We will use a better duplicate detection method such as NRIC to detect duplicates. Currently, if there are 2 people 
named "John Doe", it will be impossible to insert them. The duplicate detection is also flawed as "John Doe" and
"john doe" are seen as different people.

9. We will cater to different types of contract in the future. For example, contracts with no contract end date.

10. We will improve find command to search for users based on similarity score like Google's search engine. For example,
 "find n/John Doe" will return all the names with "John Doe" first before returning the names with "John" and the names 
with "Doe".
