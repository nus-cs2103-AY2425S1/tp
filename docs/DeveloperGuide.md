## **Acknowledgements**

ChatGPT was heavily used to help create test case templates, although the ideas behind the test cases were mostly thought by the developers.
<br>
We would also like to acknowledge group CS2103T-W14-1 as we followed a similar format for the command explanations in the user guide based on their user guide, 
and group CS2103-F10-2 as we followed their test cases for saving data based on their developer guide.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("inputString")` API call as an example. <br>
`inputString` refers to any valid addClaimCommandInput that can be passed in.

<puml src="diagrams/add-claim/AddClaimSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addClaim` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddClaimCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `AddClaimCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddClaimCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a claim to a client).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</box>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file `InSUREance.jar` and copy it into an empty folder.
   2. Use the command `java -jar InSUREance.jar` to launch the app.
   3. Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimal.

2. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   2. Re-launch the app by using the command `java -jar InSUREance.jar`<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.


### Deleting a client

1. Deleting a client while all clients are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all clients using the `list` command. Multiple clients in the list.

   2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   3. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No client is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the number of clients displayed)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing data files

   1. Delete `config.json` and re-launch the app. Expected: New `config.json` created. Existing data is not affected.

   2. Delete `preferences.json` and re-launch the app. Expected: New `preferences.json` created. Existing data is not affected. 
   
   3. Edit the line `"addressBookFilePath"` : `"data/addressbook.json"` to `"addressBookFilePath"` : `"data/data.json"` and re-launch the app. Expected: App starts on clean slate (i.e. with sample data only). 

   4. Delete `data/` or `data/addressbook.json`. Expected: New `data/addressbook.json` created. App starts on clean slate (i.e. with sample data only).

2. Dealing with corrupted data files 
   1. Add a new field `"newField" : "newField"` to a client. Expected: All data is lost. The app starts on a clean slate.
   2. Remove `"insurancePlans"` field from a client. Expected: All data is lost. The app starts on a clean slate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix : Planned Enhancements**
Do note we have 4 members in our group.

### 1. addClaim ID
A single claim ID can be added to multiple users. i.e. `B1100` can be added to both client `A` and client `B` with no error.
This will be fixed in a future version such that claim ID is unique across all clients.

### 2. addClaim amount
Claim amount can currently exceed 1 million. In the future, a restriction will be placed on the claim amount such that if
the claim amount is over 1 million, it will be rejected with an appropriate error message. This is in line with our
restriction on claim amount (claim amount cannot exceed 1 million).

### 3. Add command and Edit Command does not allow clients to have same names yet allows two people to have the same contact details
Currently, the way the system checks if a person is a duplicate is simply by checking if the person has the same
name or not. However, in future versions, we are planning to check if all details are the same before flagging it as a
duplicate. This is because 2 people can share numbers, address and emails (eg a parent and child) or 2 clients can have
the same full name with different contact details, but it will be unreasonably rare for clients to have the same name,
number, email and addresses simultaneously.

### 4. Some common names are not allowed to be entered
Currently, our app does not allow some common names with some special characters to be entered. An example
is "s/o" or "d/o". This will be fixed in a future version because we will change the way we parse the add and edit
commands.

### 5. No wrapping for very long UI details
Currently, if the name, tags or other details are very long, they are cut off in the UI. This will be fixed in a future
version by enabling wrapping for texts in the UI such that they are more easily viewable.

### 6. Currently, our find function only supports finding by name
This may not be ideal when you want to find clients by what insurance plans they have. This will be supported
in a future version when we enhance the find function to search by finding insurance plans.

### 7. Flexible Command Keywords.
Command keywords are currently case-sensitive i.e. `add` is a valid command but `Add` is not. For user convenience, we
will make command keywords case-insensitive in a future update by parsing the prefixes differently.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Effort**
Most of the difficulty in our project stems from the challenge of trying to **integrate mutable objects into an established immutable project**. While we knew the project was developed based on the principles of immutability, we felt in our case, it was better to use mutable objects for insurance plans and claims as the lists and claims were objects that were changed frequently unlike details that were currently found in addressbook level-3 such as names, emails and phone numbers. This would allow future developers to also work more easily with the given code base as adding and removing plans, introducing new insurance related features would be much more easily implemented with less code. We also wanted to challenge ourselves to see if this was possible at all.

The **biggest hurdle** to overcome with this project was **modifying the testing methods**. The test methods were mostly designed for immutable objects and there were strict tests like JsonSerializableAddressBookTest which were the most difficult to pass. This is because the test compares the hardcoded file of clients to a generated file of clients. However, at first since we were making the objects mutable, the generated file becomes different in comparison to the hardcoded file ONLY during the full testing sequence. When the test was done individually, the test passes. We scratched our heads over this for a very long time and eventually managed to solve this problem by changing the equals method for `Client` object and also the `InsurancePlansManager` object.

However, **this fix initially caused other tests break**. This includes tests like `addClaimCommandTest.java` as the `assertCommandSuccess` method in `TestUtil.java` did not compare actual and expected models correctly. This meant that even if there were some changes in the insurance plan manager, sometimes the two models are evaluated as equal to each other. We then had to create new assert methods for commands (like assertInsuranceCommandSuccess) for all the insurance plan related objects.

Our implementations were at **least as difficult compared to half of AB-3 effort**. While we did not have to create many huge structures from scratch like the `ModelManager`, `Logic` and `Storage` components, we had to work with moving parts compared to AB-3. AB-3 does not support any form in automatic sorting. However, since we wanted a quick and easy way for insurance managers to view their most critical claims, we implemented an automatic sorting of claims for each client to show their respective open claims first.

Lastly, as our **project involved money**, a sensitive value that has to be precise and accurate, we decided to store all values in cents. This was to avoid having to use float (and having issues with floating point accuracy). However, this led to **greater care required to parse and convert values** to cents and ended up being a very time-consuming method to unit test.
