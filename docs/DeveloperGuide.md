## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the application.

Given below is a quick overview of the main components of the application and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/hallpointer/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/hallpointer/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the application launch and shut down.

- At application launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components, and the corresponding classes are in the `hallpointer.address.commons` package.

The bulk of the application's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The user interface of the app.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Handles parsing and executing the commands received through user input.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the application in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other when the user issues the command `delete_member 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above) has these properties:

- It defines its _API_ (Application Programming Interface) in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- It implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned above).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (to prevent outside components being coupled to the concrete implementation of a component), as illustrated in the partial class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

While the `Storage` component provides an abstraction layer for persistent data, it also exposes access to specific data structures, such as `ReadOnlyHallPointer` and `UserPrefs`. This design balances abstraction with the need for practical access to certain data classes critical to the application’s functionality.

Ideally, the `Storage` interface would fully abstract storage details by exposing methods like `getHallPointerData()` or `getUserPreferences()`, thus hiding specifics like `ReadOnlyHallPointer`. However, for simplicity and to meet the application’s needs, `Storage` directly returns these specific data structures.

The sections below give more details about each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/hallpointer/address/ui/Ui.java), and a partial but representative class diagram thereof is shown below.

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of various parts like `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MemberListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` and so on. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w14-3.github.io/tree/master/src/main/java/hallpointer/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w14-3.github.io/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component has the following responsibilities:

- Passing user commands to the `Logic` component using its reference thereof, so that the commands can be parsed and executed.
- Keeping the display up to date with `Model` data, by listening for changes in `Model` data to update the display when appropriate.

It also depends on some classes in the `Model` component like the `Member` or `Session` classes, the details of which inform what sort of visual layout is appropriate.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/hallpointer/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a representative class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking an API call `execute("delete_member 1")` as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteMemberCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, the API call is passed to an `HallPointerParser` object, which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g. `DeleteMemberCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g. `DeleteMemberCommand`) being created, which is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The `Command` communicates with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a member).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is then returned by `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `HallPointerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (where `XYZCommandParser` is a placeholder for the specific `Command` parser class that matches the API call e.g. `AddMemberCommandParser`). This newly created `Parser` then parses the user command, creating and returning a `XYZCommand` object (e.g. `AddMemberCommand`) as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g. `AddMemberCommandParser`, `DeleteSessionCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible, making adding more commands and further testing easier.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/hallpointer/address/model/Model.java)

Here's a representative class diagram of the `Model` component:

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component has the following responsibilites:

- Storing the HallPointer data (i.e. any `Member` and `Session` objects) in memory for easy access.
- Storing the currently 'selected' `Member` objects (e.g. the results of a search query) in a separate _filtered_ list, one which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Member>` that can be 'observed'. This allows the UI to observe the list and automatically update when the data in the list changes.
- Storing a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences, and exposing it to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.

It does not depend on any of the other three components, as the `Model` represents data entities of the application and domain, and thus should make sense on its own without depending on other components.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/hallpointer/address/storage/Storage.java)

Here's a representative class diagram of the `Storage` component:

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component has the following responsibilities:

- Saving HallPointer data and user preferences data to disk in JSON format.
- Parsing the saved JSON data back into the corresponding objects when the application is re-opened.

It inherits from both `Storage` and `UserPrefStorage`, allowing it to be treated as either one, depending on the functionality needed.

It depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as its job is to save and retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

- is a CCA leader in a NUS Hall
- is responsible for managing member participation, tracking attendance, and allocating points
- prefers streamlined solutions to minimize manual administrative work
- comfortable with both desktop applications and command-line interfaces (CLI)
- often managing multiple responsibilities, including academic workload and hall duties

**Value proposition**: Hall Pointer empowers CCA leaders in NUS Halls to efficiently manage member tracking by streamlining participation recording, points allocation, and member information (such as room addresses). It simplifies manual data management, allowing leaders to focus on organizing activities rather than administrative tasks. Ideal for small, close-knit CCAs, it ensures quick access to updated information, enabling accurate and easy sharing of participation records with hall management or other stakeholders.

### Glossary

### **HallPointer Developer Glossary**

1. **Hall Points:**\
   Points allocated to members based on attendance and participation in CCA sessions, stored as part of each member's record.

2. **Member:**\
   A participant or member of a CCA (Co-Curricular Activity) in NUS Halls, whose details are tracked in Hall Pointer (e.g. name, telegram, points, and attendance).

3. **Session:**\
   A data model representing an event or activity within a CCA, where attendance is tracked and points are awarded to associated members.

4. **Tag:**\
   Labels or categories assigned to members in Hall Pointer (e.g. `leader`, `active`, `inactive`). Tags help classify and manage members more easily.

5. **Command:**\
   A user-entered instruction (e.g. `add_member`) in the CLI, enabling various operations within HallPointer. Commands are processed by the `Logic` component.

6. **Model Component:**\
   Manages data and business logic within HallPointer, including members, sessions, and hall points. The Model component keeps data in memory for efficient access.

7. **Storage Component:**\
   Responsible for data persistence, handling read/write operations to save members, sessions, and preferences in JSON format.

## **Planned Enhancements**

Team Size: 5

1. **Support Non-Numeric Room Identifiers**
   Currently, room identifiers must follow the format `block-floor-room number` (e.g. `10-3-100`), and only numeric values are supported for each component. We plan to enhance this feature by allowing non-numeric values for `block`,`floor` and `room number`.

   **Example Requirement**:

   > Room identifier should be in the format `block-floor-room number`, allowing non-numeric values for `block`, `floor` and `room number`:
   >
   > - Example: `A-G-101B`, where `A` represents the block, `G` represents the floor, and `101B` represents the room number.

   This change will add flexibility by supporting alphanumeric characters in the block and room sections.

2. **Partial Search for Session Names**
   Currently, users can only search for sessions by entering the exact first word of the session name using the `find_sessions` command. This can be inconvenient for users who want to list all sessions or search using only part of the session name. We can mitigate this by updating the `find_sessions` command to allow for partial search.

   **Example Requirement**:

   > The `find_sessions` command should allow partial name searches so users can input only the first part of the session name to retrieve all matching sessions.
   >
   > - Example: Searching with the keyword "BAD" would show all sessions starting with "BAD," rather than requiring the exact first word.

   This enhancement will improve user experience by making session searches more flexible and efficient.

3. **Flexible Member Search by Additional Fields**  
   Currently, searching for members by room or other important fields, like the Telegram handle, is not supported.

   **Example Requirement**:

   > Expand the `find_members` command to support searching by additional fields, such as `block/floor/room number`, `Telegram handle` and `Tags`.

   These enhancements will improve the usability of the `find_members` command, making it easier to locate members efficiently by various identifiers or by partial names.

4. **Command Aliases for Improved Usability**
   The current command names (e.g. `add_session`, `add_member`) are lengthy and require the use of underscores, which can be cumbersome for users to type frequently.

   **Example Requirement**:

   > Introduce shorter command aliases as an alternative to full command names to reduce typing effort, especially for frequent actions.
   >
   > - Example: Instead of typing `add_member`, users could simply type `addm` to execute the same command.

   This enhancement will streamline user interaction, making the application more efficient and user-friendly, especially for power users.

5. **`update_session` Command for Session Edits**
   Currently, session details—including members, session name, date, and points—are fixed upon creation and cannot be modified, which is problematic when adjustments are necessary. The current solution is to delete the session and create a new session with the updated details. This can be enhanced through the creation of an `update_session` command.

   **Example Requirement**:

   > Add an `update_session` command to allow users to modify session details after creation, such as adding or removing members, correcting session name or date, and adjusting session points if updated later.
   >
   > - Example: Users should be able to add a member who received a medical absence during the original session creation without creating a duplicate.

   This enhancement will improve flexibility and reduce the need for users to recreate sessions from scratch when updates are required.

6. **Allow Manual Point Adjustments**
   Currently, points can only be awarded or adjusted through sessions. This setup can be restrictive for users who need to manage points directly, without creating a session.

   **Example Requirement**:

   > Update the `update_member` command to manually add or adjust points for individual members, allowing flexible point management outside of sessions.
   >
   > - Example: An `add_points` command could let users award or modify points for members directly, without requiring a session link, accommodating various tracking needs.

   This enhancement would allow users to manage point allocations more flexibly, streamlining adjustments and providing greater control over point tracking.
