### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### General Interaction

The general interactions within the `Logic` component is shown in the sequence diagram below, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person and his/her [participation](#participation-class)).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** 

For more information on the interactions of features with the Logic Component, please refer [here](#implementation).
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the currently ‘selected’ `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate *filtered* list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be ‘observed’ e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores `Tutorial` objects as a separate list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tutorial>` that can be observed.
* stores `Participation` objects as a separate list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Participation>` that can be observed.
* Each `Participation` object is also composed of a `Tutorial` object, a `Person` object, and a `List<Attendance>` object. More information on this [here](#storage-feature).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** 
Some of our classes are still named AddressBook instead of EduVault to honor the legacy code. Additionally,
the name AddressBook aligns with the current functionality of the class.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>



### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:**
`Students` are named as `Persons` due to Legacy code.
</div>


### Storage feature

EduVault stores data in JSON file using the Jackson library.

EduVault stores four types of objects:
* `Student` (`Person`)
* `Tutorial`
* `Participation`
* `Attendance`

An overarching structure of the JSON file is as shown below:

```dtd
{
    "persons" : [...],
    "tutorials" : [...],
    "participations" : [...]
}
```

<br>

Within each of the different objects (`Student`, `Tutorial`, `Participation`), data is stored in the following format as shown below. Conditions for storage are also included.

`Student`
```dtd
"persons" :
[
    {
        "name" : "Alex Yeoh",
        "phone" : "87438807",
        "email" : "alexyeoh@example.com",
        "address" : "Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40",
        "payment" : "189",
        "tags" : [ "Scholar" ]
    },
    ...
]
```
**Condition:** There may be no duplicate `Students`.
Two `Students` are considered to be duplicates if they have matching `name` and `phone`.

`Tutorial`
```dtd
"tutorials" :
[
    {
        "subject" : "Mathematics"
    },
    ...
]
```
**Condition:** There may be no duplicate `Tutorials`.
Two `Tutorials` are considered to be duplicates if they have matching `subject`.

`Participation`
```dtd
"participations" :
[
    {
        "student" : "Alex Yeoh",
        "phone" : "87438807",
        "tutorial" : "Mathematics",
        "attendances" : [...]
    },
]
```
**Condition:**
1. Each `Participation` must have a `Student` with matching `Name` and `Phone`, and `Tutorial` with matching `Subject`, to be considered valid.

2. There may be no duplicate `Participations`.
Two `Participations` are considered to be duplicates if the `Student` and `Tutorial` are the same.

`Attendance`
```dtd
"attendances" :
[
    {
        "attendanceDate" : "02/02/2024"
    }
]
```

**Condition:** There may be no duplicate `Attendances`.
1. Two `Attendances` are considered to be duplicates if the `attendanceDate` occurs in the same week of week-based-year.

2. EduVault selects the first `Attendance` of duplicate `Attendance` entries as defined above to load from storage.

##### Uniqueness of objects
For the purposes of storage into JSON format, EduVault defines two objects as distinct based on these factors:

* Two `Students` are considered to be duplicates if they have matching `name` and `phone`.
* Two `Tutorials` are considered to be duplicates if they have matching `subject`.
* Two `Participations` are considered to be duplicates if the `name`, `phone` and `subject` are the same (`Student` and `Tutorial` identifiers).
* Two `Attendances` are considered to be duplicates if the `attendanceDate` occurs in the same week of week-based-year.

##### Loading Order
The order which storage loads `Person`, `Tutorial` and `Participation` is shown below. 

![StorageToModelTypeActivityDiagram](images/StorageToModelTypeActivityDiagram.png)

`Person` and `Tutorial` objects are loaded into the `AddressBook` first.

The `Participation` objects are created using corresponding `Person` and `Tutorial` objects in the `AddressBook`
based on [uniqueness](#uniqueness-of-objects).


### Find feature


The implementation of the Find feature follows closely with the general format provided in the Logic Component [above](#logic-component).
![FindSequenceDiagram-Logic](images/FindSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

Due to the complexity of the command, there is an extra helper class `PredicateFactory` when `AddressBookParser` calls `parse("n/Alex ...")`
![FindCommandParseSequence](images/FindCommandParseSequence.png)

The main steps for this execution are:

1. The user inputs the command `find n/Alex tut/Science ...` to find students with these properties
2. **LogicManager** receives the command and calls `parseCommand("find n/Alex tut/Science ...")` on AddressBookParser to interpret the input.
3. **AddressBookParser** receives the command and identifies that it’s a find command. It calls `parse("n/Alex tut/Science ...")` on FindCommandParser to parse the specific details.
4. **FindCommandParser** processes the arguments `("n/Alex tut/Science ...")` into an argument map, and passes it to `PredicateFactory`.
5. **PredicateFactory** processes the given argument map into `personPredicates` of type `Predicate<Person>` and `participationPredicates` of type `Predicate<Participation>`, and creates an instance of FindCommand
5. **LogicManager** then calls `execute(model)` on the created FindCommand to carry out the find operation.
6. **FindCommand** proceeds to filter the relevant data from the Model instance.


### Enroll and Unenroll feature

The implementation of the Enroll and Unenroll feature follows closely with the general format provided in the Logic Component [above](#logic-component). The implementation of these two commands are also similar to each other. So as an example, only the sequence diagram for Enroll feature when the user inputs `enroll 1 tut/math` will be shown below.

![EnrollStudentSequenceDiagram-Logic](images/EnrollStudentSequenceDiagram.png)


The main steps for this execution are:

1. The user inputs the command `enroll 1 tut/math` to enroll the student at index 1 into a math tutorial.
2. **LogicManager** receives the command and calls `parseCommand("enroll 1 tut/math")` on AddressBookParser to interpret the input.
3. **AddressBookParser** receives the command and identifies that it’s an enrollment command. It calls `parse("1 tut/math")` on EnrollCommandParser to parse the specific details.
4. **EnrollCommandParser** processes the arguments `("1 tut/math")` and creates an instance of EnrollCommand, which is configured to enroll the specified student in the math tutorial.
5. **LogicManager** then calls `execute(model)` on the created EnrollCommand to carry out the enrollment operation.
6. **EnrollCommand** proceeds to retrieve the relevant data from the Model instance, and then adding the student to the math tutorial, by creating a `Participation` object. 


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">:bulb: **Tip:**

Details of the Participation class are included [below](#participation-class).
</div>

<ol start="7">
    <li>Once the enrollment is completed, EnrollCommand returns a <b>CommandResult</b> with a message indicating the successful enrollment.</li>
    <li>The result then flows back through <b>LogicManager</b>.</li>
</ol>


<br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** 

The implementation of the Unenroll feature is similar to that of the example given above, but instead of `addParticipation(...)` method of the Model Component being called, `deleteParticipation(...)` is called.

</div>

<br>

#### Participation Class
`Participation` is an **association** class used to represent the relationship between a student and a tutorial, as well as his/her attendance, which is stored in a List. Below is a class diagram denoting such a relationship.

<img src="images/ParticipationAsAssociationDiagram.png" width="400" />

When storing data, each `Participation` object is stored separately from `Student` and `Tutorial`. Please refer to the [Storage Feature](#storage-feature) for more information of how the `Participation` objects are being stored.

### Add Student and Create Tutorial feature

The implementation of the Add Student and Create Tutorial feature follows closely with the general format provided in the Logic Component [above](#logic-component). The implementation of these two commands are also similar to each other. So as an example, only the sequence diagram for **Add Student** feature when the user inputs `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`  will be shown below.   

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** 

For simplicity's sake, we use `add n/…` to represent the user input in the sequence diagram below.
</div>

![AddCommandSequenceDiagram-Logic](images/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The main steps for execution are similar to the Enroll and Unenroll feature documented [above](#enroll-and-unenroll-feature). The main difference is that **AddCommandParser** does not process the index and the `tut` prefix, but instead, it processes other prefixes like `n/` and  `e/`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** 

Between Add Student and Create Tutorial feature, the main difference is with regard to how they access the Model Component. Create Tutorial calls `hasTutorial(...)` and `createTutorial(...)`  method from the Model Component instead.
</div>

### Delete Student and Close Tutorial feature

The implementation of the Delete Student and Close Tutorial feature follows closely with the general format provided in the Logic Component [above](#logic-component). The implementation of these two commands are also similar to each other. So as an example, only the sequence diagram for Delete Student feature when the user inputs `delete 1` will be shown below. 

Note that this sequence diagram is the same as the one used in [Logic Component](#logic-component), but it is added here for easier referencing.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

The main steps for execution are similar to the Enroll and Unenroll feature documented [above](#enroll-and-unenroll-feature), ignoring the difference in parsers and commands being executed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:**

Between Delete Student and Close Tutorial feature, the main difference is with regard to how they access the Model Component. Instead of calling student-related methods such as `getFilteredPersonList()` and `deletePerson(...),` Close Tutorial calls tutorial-related methods like `getTutorialList()` and `deleteTutorial(...)` instead.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:**
`Student` are named as `Person` due to Legacy code.
</div>

### List and Clear feature

The implementation of the List and Clear feature **deviates** slightly from the general format provided in the Logic Component [above](#logic-component). Since there are no arguments used when executing these commands, they will not require a `Parser` to check the inputs. As these two commands are similar to each other, so only the sequence diagram for List feature when the user inputs `list` will be shown below.

![ListCommandSequenceDiagram-Logic](images/ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The main steps for this execution are:

1. The user inputs the command `list` to display all students.
2. **LogicManager** receives the command and calls `parseCommand("list")` on AddressBookParser to interpret the input.
3. **AddressBookParser** receives the command and identifies that it is a list command. It directly creates an instance of **ListCommand**, since there are no arguments to parse.
4. **LogicManager** then calls `execute(model)` on the created **ListCommand** to perform the listing operation.
5. **ListCommand** then retrieves and update the list.
6. After updating the list, **ListCommand** returns a **CommandResult** with a message indicating that the list operation has been completed successfully.
7. The result then flows back to **LogicManager**.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** 

The implementation of the Clear feature is similar to that of the example given above, but instead of `updateFilteredPersonList(...)` method of the Model Component being called, `setAddressBook(...)` is called.

</div>



### Help and Exit feature

The implementation of the Help and Exit feature **deviates** from the general format provided in the Logic Component [above](#logic-component). Since there are no arguments used when executing these commands, they will not require a `Parser` to check the inputs. In addition, they will not be accessing the `Model` Component, since these two features are not updating or retrieving data. As these two commands are similar to each other, so only the sequence diagram for **Help** feature when the user inputs `help` will be shown below.

![HelpCommandSequenceDiagram-Logic](images/HelpCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Tha main steps of execution are similar to the [List and Clear feature](#list-and-clear-feature), excluding Step 5.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** 

The implementation of the Exit feature is similar to that of the example given above.

</div>

---

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:pushpin: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

This product is for admins at tuition centres who have to track a large number of student records. Besides requiring to manage a large number of records, the admin also:

* prefers desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

Enable easy management and fast access to student records for administrators working at tuition centres. We aim to provide easy tracking of payments and attendance, along with classes enrollment. This also helps tuition centres save time by reducing administrative burdens on their staff.

## **Appendix: Effort**

**Effort Report for Project**

**Difficulty Level**:
The project was moderately challenging due to the integration of additional entities and the complexity of building and maintaining relationships between them.

**Challenges Faced**:

* **Entity Expansion**: Unlike AB3, which manages a single entity type (Person), our project introduces a new entity,
*Tutorial*, and connects it with the existing *Person* entity through an intermediary *Participation* entity.
This additional entity required designing and implementing a relationship model that could effectively manage student
enrollment and attendance across multiple tutorials.
* **Feature Development**: To fully support the new *Tutorial* entity, we had to build several new core features, such
as *enrollment*, *payment*, and *attendance tracking*. Additionally, we enhanced existing features, including the *find*
functionality, to work seamlessly across both *Person* and *Tutorial* entities.
* **Data Storage**: The introduction of *Tutorial* and *Participation* entities required an update to the JSON storage
architecture. We modified the storage layer to accommodate both the *tutorial list* and *participation list*
while ensuring data consistency and easy retrieval.
* **User Interface Enhancements**: To make the system more intuitive and user-friendly, we upgraded the GUI,
introducing new elements for tutorial management and enhancing the overall design.

**Effort Required**:
We estimate that the project required more than double the expected effort due to the additional entities and feature
expansions. We prioritized extensive testing and compliance with coding standards to ensure the robustness and
maintainability of our code. We went the extra mile for passion and our own learning.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5
1. **Improve Responsiveness of User Interface**: Our current application uses JavaFX for the GUI. However, as the application
has grown in complexity, users may occasionally experience lag and need to refresh the GUI to view updated information.
To address this issue, we plan to implement an automatic refresh functionality for our GUI after every command to 
improve its responsiveness.
2. **Fee Limit Warning**: Currently, there is no cap on the total fees that can be added for a student. To enhance user
awareness, we plan to introduce a warning message if a student’s total fees exceed $2,000, allowing the user to confirm
before proceeding. This will help prevent unintentional overcharging or overpaying. This will also prevent user from
accidentally entering a number that is too large.
3. **Integrate Tutorial Fees with Payment**: Currently, tutorial fees are not directly connected to a student’s payment
status. We aim to integrate tutorial fees with the payment system, so any fees associated with a tutorial will
automatically update a student’s overdue amount through enhancement 1, simplifying the tracking process for administrators.
4. **Add Timing for Tutorials**: Tutorials currently lack a time attribute, making scheduling difficult. We plan to add
a “Timing” attribute to tutorials, enabling administrators to view and manage class schedules more effectively.
5. **Support for Education Levels in Tutorials**: Tutorials currently do not distinguish between education levels. To
improve categorization and management, we plan to add an “Education Level” (eg, Secondary 1-Math, Junior College
2-Chemistry), allowing administrators to group tutorials by levels such as primary, secondary, or advanced.
6. **Support For Special Characters in Names**: Currently, special characters such as '/' are not allowed in the name
field.
In the future, we plan to enhance the application to allow such characters in name inputs.
7. **Batch Enroll/Unenroll for Multiple Students**: The current system allows enrolling or unenrolling one
student into one tutorial at a time. We plan to add functionality for batch enrollments and unenrollments, allowing
administrators to enroll or unenroll multiple students from a tutorial at once
8. **Enhance Error Message specificity**: Currently, certain error messages related to invalid user input are either too
vague or not displayed at all. Specifically, if a user includes a prefix that does not fall within the command's scope,
the command will not return an error message. Instead, it might process the prefix as a string input and passes it to
other fields, potentially causing additional errors. Moving forward, we plan to restrict the use of invalid prefixes based on
the specific command to ensure more precise error handling.
9. **Allowing Multiple Attendance Records**: Currently, attendance can only be recorded once per tutorial per week.
This is to ensure user do not accidentally key in the wrong attendance, which results in duplicate weekly attendance. We plan to allow multiple attendance within the
same week for the same tutorial, but the system will show a warning message. This is to give users more flexibility
to plan additional classes.
10. **Enhance Find Command with list sorted by relevance**: The current “Find” command uses AND logic to combine multiple
conditions, which can limit search results when looking for students that only satisfy one of the conditions. We plan to enhance
this command by allowing OR logic. Results that matches the OR command would be displayed below results that matches
the AND logic. Basically, the list would be sorted by their relevance to the search.
