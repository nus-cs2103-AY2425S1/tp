## **Acknowledgements**

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the SE-EDU initiative.
* Libraries used: JavaFX, Jackson, JUnit5
* The undo and redo features were inspired by the proposed implementation found in [AB3's Developer Guide](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/DeveloperGuide.html#proposed-undoredo-feature).
* The icons used were taken from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
* Use of GPT for auto-complete tool feature (A0272009L Saajid)
> Mutliple bugs and issues due to interaction between suggestion and autocompleting -> GPT generated code which broke down current code into multiple functions and structured for individual purposes. Thereafter, the code was modified to resolved more specific exepected outcomes to suit the needs of the app. (ChatGPT makes multiple serious mistakes, it CANNOT implement this feature AT ALL without substantial amount of human intervention)

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### Implementation

The image below shows the class diagram of a Person object and its related class attributes.

![Person Class Diagram](images/PersonClassDiagram.png)

The Person object is made up of several attributes:
* `Name`: The name of the patient.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the patient.
* `Email`: The email of the patient.
* `Address`: The address of the patient.
* `Doctor`: The doctor assigned to the patient.
* `Emergency Contact`: A list of emergency contacts of the patient.
* `Tags`: Additional information about the patient.

The Doctor object is also made up of attributes:
* `Doctor Name`: The name and title of the doctor.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the doctor.
* `Email`: The email of the doctor.

The Emergency Contact object is also made up of attributes:
* `Name`: The name of the emergency contact.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the emergency contact.
* `Relationship`: The relationship of the emergency contact to the patient.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Feature details

1. MedConnect will verify that the parameters supplied by the user follow a set of relevant restrictions for the respective parameters.
2. If any invalid parameter is provided, an error will be thrown, informing the user which parameter violates the restrictions. The format for the valid input for that parameter will be displayed to the user.
3. If all parameters are valid, a new `Person` entry will be created and stored in the `VersionedAddressBook`.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: The required input of parameters:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Make all parameters compulsory, except Tags.
  * Pros: Will not have missing data when it is needed in an emergency.
  * Cons: Add Command is lengthy to type out, might be hard to remember the syntax.
* **Alternative 2:** Make only a few specific parameters compulsory.
  * Pros: Patient registration will be faster.
  * Cons: If user forgets to update missing details, during an emergency there might not be an emergency contact to call.

We opted for Alternative 1 to make almost all parameters compulsory as the autocomplete feature we implemented will aid users in typing out the Add Command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Data archiving

#### Implementation

The archive functionality in MedConnect is facilitated by the `ModelManager` class. It handles the archiving, listing, loading, and deleting of archived contact data. The `ModelManager` interacts with the `Filename` class and `FileUtil` components to manage the archive files in the archive directory.

For example, the sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `ModelManager` component when the `archive` command is executed.

![ArchiveSequenceDiagram.png](images%2FArchiveSequenceDiagram.png)

1. The `ArchiveCommand` archives the current address book data by calling the `archiveAddressBook` method in the `ModelManager` component.
2. The `ModelManager` creates the archive directory if it does not exist.
3. The `ModelManager` saves the current address book data to a JSON file in the archive directory with the specified file name.

  Contact information should be stored in a **human-readable and editable format** (e.g., `.json` or `.csv`) so that administrators can manually access and modify data if needed.

- **Data Integrity:**
  The system must ensure that no data is lost or corrupted during common operations (e.g., adding, updating, or deleting contacts). **Transaction-like behavior** must be implemented to ensure all data operations either succeed fully or fail without partially corrupting data.

#### 5. Compatibility and Portability:
- **Cross-Platform Support:**
  MedConnect must be compatible with **mainstream operating systems** (Windows, macOS, Linux) and function seamlessly on systems with **Java 17 or higher** installed.

#### 6. Maintainability and Extensibility:
- **Modular Design:**
  The system must be designed with a modular structure, allowing future extensions such as additional data fields or user roles without requiring significant rework.

- **Testability:**
  MedConnect must be **easily testable**, with automated tests that can cover at least **70% of the codebase**. Each core feature (e.g., adding a contact, deleting outdated contacts) should have dedicated test cases.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 4

The current version of MedConnect has its flaws so here are our plans for future enhancements to improve future versions of MedConnect.

### Optimisations to handle large number of contacts

Currently, depending on the limitations of the PC hardware that MedConnect is running on, a large number of contacts may cause an OutOfMemory error. Our planned enhancement is to optimise the data storage and retrieval process to handle a larger number of contacts without causing performance issues or memory errors, or implement a pagination feature to display contacts in smaller batches. We plan to also implement an import and export feature to allow users to import and export contacts in bulk to avoid the need to manually enter each contact.

### Duplicate detection

Currently, MedConnect's duplicate person detection only works within each class. There is no duplicate person detection between a patient and a doctor. In reality, there should likely not be a case where a patient is also a doctor. We plan to implement duplicate person detection across classes to prevent or display a warning message to prevent a person from being added as both a patient and a doctor, for instance, in the future.

### Whitespaces in names

Currently, MedConnect is able to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from names. However, the functionality to remove whitespaces in between words in a name is not yet implemented. We plan to implement this in the future to prevent users from entering names with excessive whitespaces between words in the future as it may reduce readability.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Handling long fields

Currently, MedConnect does not handle long fields well. For example, if a user enters a long name, the name may be cut off in the GUI. Our planned enhancement is to implement a feature that allows users to view the full details of each field by hovering over the field in the GUI or clicking to expand the details for the field in the card. This will allow users to view the full field (e.g. full name) should the field be too long to be displayed in the GUI.

### Multiple Language Support

Currently, MedConnect is only available for usage in English. We recognise that our target users may not be able to read English proficiently or require non-English inputs (e.g. Chinese names). Our planned enhancement is to translate MedConnect into other languages, such as Chinese, Malay and Tamil to accommodate for healthcare administrators who are more fluent in these languages and require such languages to be supported in the application.

### Emergency Contact UI

Currently, clicking on a emergency contact card of a patient in the GUI, followed by clicking the same patient card results in the emergency contact card being unselected. This behavior is not ideal for users who select the card to focus on viewing the correct contact in the list. Our planned enhancement is to update the behaviour of selecting the patient card so that it will not refresh the user's selection upon clicking it.

### Autocomplete field suggestion

Currently, due to difficulties with parsing, the autocomplete feature does not suggest square brackets for optional fields, such as in the Edit command. Users would have to refer to the User Guide or error message to know which fields are optional. We plan to add the square brackets to clearly indicate optional parameters in the autocomplete feature in future iterations of MedConnect to minimise the need for users to continuously reference the User Guide.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Autocomplete dynamic parsing

Currently, the autocomplete feature does not dynamically parse the user's input for each parameter  as it is entered to provide the next suggestion. For example, the autocomplete feature would not function ideally if users enter a whitespace after command prefixes (e.g., `add n/    John` would continue to suggest `add n/    John (n/NAME)`). This also limits us to keep to the specified default order of parameters. We plan to implement dynamic parsing in the autocomplete feature to provide more accurate suggestions based on the user's input in future iterations of MedConnect, particularly for optional parameters. This would also improve the user experience by allowing us to carry out input validation for each parameter and provide feedback to the user in real-time without the need to submit the command.

## **Appendix: Effort**

Developing MedConnect as a brownfield project from the upgrading of AB3 was challenging for us as a team of relatively junior software engineers who did not have much experience in a software engineering project.
For some of our team members, the only prior software engineering experience we had was our Orbital project.

Initially, we faced many challenges in managing the Git workflow of creating issues, creating branches, merging branches and pull requests.
This was because the process was new to most of the group and we carefully took the time to learn the proper workflow and avoid merge conflicts.

Another challenge we faced was implementing the autocomplete feature. Since MedConnect was directed to be used by fast typists, we brainstormed the idea of having an autocomplete feature to greatly benefit them.
However, this idea was quite foreign to all of us and we took a great deal of time in figuring out how to tackle this problem.
In due time, we managed to figure out a solution as a team and it is now implemented in the current version of MedConnect.

Finally, for the undo and redo feature, we adapted the proposed implementation provided in the developer guide of AB3.
This greatly reduced the effort required for these features as there are many ways to implement them.
A more complex solution would be for each command to have its own respective undo and redo implementation.
However, we followed the proposed implementation of saving the AddressBook in states and having a pointer that points to the current state.
The pointer would move between states upon execution of the undo and redo commands.

Overall, we faced many challenges as a team that we had to overcome over a short runway.
We managed to stay afloat and tackle these challenges through constant communication and good teamwork between team members, helping each other out swiftly and decisively.
