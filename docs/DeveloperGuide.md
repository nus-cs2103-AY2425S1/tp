## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

The `CalendarViewPanel` component,

* displays appointments in a calendar view using the [`CalendarFX`](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/CalendarFX) library.
* listens for changes in the `ObservableList<Appointment>` in the `Model` component, automatically updating the calendar display when appointments are added, removed, or modified.
* includes a background thread that updates the current time pointer in the `CalendarView` every 10 seconds.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1,2")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" width="725" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F14b-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save address book data, appointment data, and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `AppointmentStorage`, and `UserPrefStorage`, allowing it to be treated as any of these types when only specific functionality is needed.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as its role is to save and retrieve objects that belong to the model.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo feature

The undo mechanism is facilitated by `Command` and `LogicManager`. `LogicManager` stores previously executed commands using a `CommandHistory` object. `Command` has the following operation:

* `Command#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰To be overridden by commands that we determine to be action commands.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command gets stored in `CommandHistory` object in `LogicManager`.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not be added to the `CommandHistory` object in `LogicManager` to be saved as a past command.

</box>

Step 3. The user now decides that deleting the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will extract the latest command excluding `undo` and call the `undo()` of the latest command.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If there is no past command to undo, an error message will be thrown to the user that this is the case rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" width="725" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Data archiving

The data archiving feature allows users to mark contacts as archived rather than permanently deleting them.
Archiving can be used to manage inactive or unneeded contacts without losing historical information or
requiring deletion, which is irreversible after the app has been exited or closed.

#### Implementation Details
The archiving feature is implemented using the `ArchiveCommand` class, which uses a boolean flag `shouldArchive`
to handle both archiving and unarchiving actions. Instead of directly modifying the `Person` object, which is immutable,
a new `Person` instance is created with the updated archive status.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchiveSequenceDiagram.puml" width="650" />

### Saving data

1. **All data is saved in two files**: `socialbook.json` for person data and `appointments.json` for appointment data.

   1. By default, these files are located in the `data` folder.
   2. Whenever a command is executed (e.g., `add`, `list`, `editappt`), the data is saved automatically to the respective files.

2. **Dealing with missing data files**:

   1. To simulate a missing file, navigate to the `data` folder (in the same location as `socialbook.jar`) and delete either `socialbook.json` or `appointments.json` (or both).
   2. Re-launch the application:<br>
      * If `socialbook.json` is missing, the app will repopulate with sample data for persons only. Appointments will not be repopulated, and the app will continue with an empty appointment list.
      * If only `appointments.json` is missing, the app will continue to run with an empty appointment list.
      * If both `socialbook.json` and `appointments.json` are missing, the app will repopulate with sample data for persons only, while appointments will remain empty.

3. **Dealing with corrupted data entries**:

   1. To simulate a corrupted data entry, open either `socialbook.json` or `appointments.json` in the `data` folder and change a compulsory field to an invalid value (e.g., set a phone number to `-1`).
   2. Re-launch SocialBook.
      * **Expected**: If either file contains corrupted data, the application will erase affected data:
        * Corrupting `socialbook.json` will clear both person and appointment data.
        * Corrupting `appointments.json` will clear only the appointment data.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

**Team Size: 5**

### 1. Adding appointments that span multiple days

- **Current Implementation:** To add appointments that span multiple days, you can add multiple consecutive appointments for each day to cover the entire period. However, this process is tedious and time-consuming.
- **Plan:** We will support adding of multi-day appointments when using the `addappt` command, so that users can add them in one step to save time and effort.

### 2. Imposing constraints on archived people

- **Current Implementation:** Archived people and their appointments can still be modified, and these appointments are still displayed in the appointment list and calendar.
- **Plan:** We will restrict this by preventing modifications to archived people and hiding/showing their appointments only when required, similar to how `list` works. For example, to view archived people, you can currently do `list archive/`. `listappt` can be modified to follow this implementation too.

### 3. Enhancing duplicate detection

- **Current Implementation:** Duplicates are taken as persons with the exact same full name. However, it can be possible that two persons share the same full name.
- **Plan:** We will enhance duplicate detection by disallowing other fields such as phone numbers and emails to be duplicated instead as these are always unique and should not be allowed to be repeated.

### 4. Enhancing validation checks

- **Current Implementation:** The validation checks for some fields are not very strict. For instance, the address can be anything that is not blank. This means the same address is treated as different if the user input differs by even 1 whitespace.
- **Plan:** We will improve on validation checks for fields like this to minimise the possibilities of user errors like adding a single whitespace, and ensure standardization of the representation of these fields.

### 5. Viewing the details of the different schemes

- **Current Implementation:** It is difficult for users to know what are the requirements for a person to be eligible for a scheme and to find out the exact details of the scheme such as the benefits.
- **Plan:** We will allow the user to view these details about available schemes using the `scheme` command, so that the details are mentioned together with the results of which schemes a person is eligible for.

### 6. Adding images to a person

- **Current Implementation:** SocialBook only shows text based information about the persons added.
- **Plan:** We will allow the user to attach a photo of the person which will be reflected in the UI to make identifying each person easier.

### 7. Making the command result box in UI bigger

- **Current Implementation:** The result of an executed command is displayed in a box that may be too small for some results. For instance, executing the `statistics` command results in all statistics being displayed but to view all the results, the user has to scroll through, which can cause some minor inconvenience.
- **Plan:** We will allow the user to resize this command result box so that they can make it bigger if they feel it is inconvenient to scroll for such command results.

### 8. Imposing constraints on extreme inputs

- **Current Implementation:** When a user is adding/editing the details of a person, they are free to make the text inputs as long as possible or the numerical inputs as large as possible. For instance, a name of 1000 characters or an income of more than 1,000,000 can be added, which is unrealistic.
- **Plan:** We will restrict these behaviours to a reasonable extent by imposing more realistic constraints on these inputs, such as limiting the maximum income to a more reasonable upper limit like 100,000.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 9. Representing entire families

- **Current Implementation:** A person represents a family that requires assistance and that person is regarded as the point of contact with that family.
- **Plan:** We will allow the user to add all people that are part of a family in a way that everyone in the same family is represented together. For instance, each person could keep track of a family index and every person sharing the same index will belong to the same family. A UI change that could accompany this is showing a family view and then a separate view of the people that make up a family when that family is clicked on.

### 10. Modifying available schemes

- **Current Implementation:** We have added two schemes that are available within SocialBook, which a person may be eligible for.
- **Plan:** We will extend this feature by allowing the user to add or delete schemes, so that they can add new schemes that are introduced in future or delete outdated schemes.
