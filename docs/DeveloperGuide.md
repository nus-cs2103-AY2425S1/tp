### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete person 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TabPane` (which contains `PersonListPanel` and `EventListPanel`), `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete event 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete event 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. The `DeleteCommandParser` parses the command and creates either a `DeletePersonCommandParser` or a `DeleteEventCommandParser` object depending on the command type, which then parses the input.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePersonCommand` or `DeleteEventCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZEventCommand` object (e.g., `ClearCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` and `Event` objects (which are contained in `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueEventList` objects).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` and `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Event and Person Synchronisation

#### Implementation
The current `Event` class has a `Person` field that stores the `Person` object associated with the event. This is because the `Event` object should be aware of the `Person` object it is associated with. This ensures that when details of the `Person` object are updated, the `Event` object is aware of the changes and can update itself accordingly. This applies to the contact list in `Event` as well.

Step 1: The user adds a new `Event` through the `add event` command. During execution of the command, the `Person` object associated with the `Event` is retrieved from the `Model` using the `findPerson` method.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Event` object is created and associated with a `Person` object:
![AddEvent](images/AddEventSequenceDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how `findPerson` method is executed and the `Person` object is retrieved:
![FindPerson](images/FindPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 2: The user updates the details of a `Person` object through the `edit person` command. During execution of the command, the updated `Person` replaces all original `Person` in relevant `Events` through the `replacePersonInEvents` method in the `Model`. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Person` object is edited:
![EditPerson](images/EditPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how `replacePersonInEvents` method is executed and the original `Person` object is replaced with the updated `Person` object:
![ReplacePerson](images/ReplacePersonInEvents.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete person 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete person` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete person 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add person n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add person` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list person`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list person`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete person`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. The software should work without requiring an installer.
3. The software should not depend on a remote server. 
4. Since the app is intended to be an offline tool, it should function fully without any internet connection.
5. The application should be packaged into a single JAR file.
6. File sizes should be reasonable and not exceed the limits given below. 
   - Product (i.e., the JAR/ZIP file): 100MB
   - Documents (i.e., PDF files): 15MB/file
7. The developer guide and user guide should be PDF-friendly. Don't use expandable panels, embedded videos, animated GIFs etc.
8. The use of third-party libraries/frameworks/services should not be used so as to improve security and stability of the application.
9. Talent managers with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
10. The application should prioritise one-shot commands over multi-step commands as they are faster. If a multi-step command is provided to help new users, a one-shot equivalent should also be provided for regular/expert users.
11. Regular tasks (e.g., adding a contact, listing events) should be executable within a few milliseconds to maintain efficiency and not interrupt the talent managerâ€™s workflow.
12. The system should efficiently handle a large database of contacts and events (e.g., 1,000+ entries), allowing for fast searches, retrievals, and modifications without performance degradation.
13. The data should be stored locally and should be in a human editable text file.
14. The data should not be stored using a Database Management System.
15. The data should be able to be loaded using a data file if the network is down.
16. The system should provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface with clear instructions and feedback to guide talent managers who are not IT-savvy in using the command-line interface effectively.
17. The GUI should work well (i.e., should not cause any resolution-related inconveniences to the user) for standard screen resolutions 1920x1080 and higher and for screen scales 100% and 125%.
18. The GUI should be usable (i.e., all functions can be used even if the user experience is not optimal) for resolutions 1280x720 and higher and for screen scales 150%.
19. As the app is an offline tool, it should be robust and able to run for extended periods without crashing. Downtime should be limited to under 1% (if any issues require restarting).
20. The system should be able to recover from crashes within 5 seconds, ensuring minimal disruption to the talent managerâ€™s workflow.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

### Team size: 5

1. **Undo/Redo Feature**: Implement an undo/redo feature for the TalentHub application. This feature will allow users to undo or redo their last action, providing a safety net for accidental deletions or modifications.
2. **Add check for overlapping dates and valid times when deserializing**: Implement a check for overlapping dates and valid times (start time before end time) when deserializing the data from the storage file. This will ensure that the data is consistent and accurate when loaded into the application.
3. **Add support for accepting empty prefix for tags and contacts during `add person` and `add event` commands**: Modify the application to recognize an empty prefix for tags and contacts when using the `add person` and `add event` commands. This will allow users to specify no tags or points of contacts when adding a person or event.
4. **Add support for choosing or viewing multiple tags for contacts in events**: Enhance the application to allow users to choose or view multiple tags for contacts in events in the GUI. This will provide more flexibility in managing contacts and events with different categories or groups.
5. **Add case-sensitive duplication check for names**: Implement case-sensitive validation for names when adding or editing persons and events. This will ensure that names are stored and displayed consistently in the application.
6. **Add feature which programmatically discerns if a person is a celebrity or industry professional**: Implement a feature that programmatically discerns if a person is a contact or a celebrity. Only celebrities would be allowed to be added as the celebrity in an event.
7. **Add stricter validation for names**: Only allow names to contain alphabets, spaces, and special characters like hyphens and apostrophes. Names should not contain numbers or other special characters.
