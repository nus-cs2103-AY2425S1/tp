### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the javaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Proposed Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Proposed Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

       Expected: Program will ignore arguments after the exit command and close immediately.



## Appendix: Effort

This project, EduTuTu, required a considerable amount of effort to design and implement due to its functionality and the combination of both Command Line Interface (CLI) and Graphical User Interface (GUI) components. Unlike simpler applications like AB3, which deals with only one entity type, EduTuTu manages multiple entities such as students, payments, and classes. Each entity has unique properties and relationships, adding complexity to the data model, command handling, and user interface design.

### Difficulty Level and Challenges
The development of EduTuTu presented several key challenges:
- **Multi-Entity Management:** Managing multiple types of entities (students, payments, classes) required a flexible data structure and sophisticated command parsing to handle diverse commands like `add`, `markpaid`, and `pie`.
- **Data Visualisation:** Creating dynamic visualisations (pie and bar charts) to track class distributions and monthly payments required integration with a charting library and customization to suit EduTuTu’s specific data needs.
- **Error Handling and User Experience:** Ensuring robust error handling and clear user feedback was essential, particularly for commands related to data visualization and file manipulation (e.g., handling missing or corrupted files).

### Effort Required
Significant effort went into:
- **Designing a Scalable Data Model:** We created a model that supports various entity types, allowing for easy future expansion.
- **Extensive Testing:** Due to the multi-entity structure and data visualisation, thorough testing was necessary to handle a wide range of user inputs and edge cases, particularly for commands such as `clear`, `undo`, and `redo`.
- **User Interface Improvements:** Balancing the CLI with GUI elements required additional effort to ensure that commands were intuitive and visualizations were accessible, providing a seamless user experience.

### Reuse of Libraries and Components
To streamline development, we leveraged certain libraries and reused components where feasible:
- **Charting Library for Visualisations:** The `javaFX` library was used to implement the `pie` and `bar` chart commands. This allowed us to focus on integrating visualization rather than building charting functionality from scratch. Our work on adapting `javaFX` to fit EduTuTu’s data structure is encapsulated in the `ChartAdapter.java` class.
- **Command Framework from AB3:** We adapted AB3’s command framework to accommodate EduTuTu’s expanded command set, allowing us to save development time while maintaining a consistent structure. Additional commands such as `markpaid` and `info` were added to extend functionality for the specific needs of a tuition center.

### Achievements
Despite the complexity, we achieved several milestones:
- Designed a flexible and scalable multi-entity data model that can be expanded easily for future needs.
- Successfully implemented user-friendly data visualisation commands (`pie`, `bar`), providing private tutors with valuable insights at a glance.
- Developed a robust system for error handling and user feedback, enhancing usability and reliability.

In summary, EduTuTu required significant effort due to its multi-entity structure, visualisations, and user interface improvements. By reusing existing libraries and frameworks strategically, we maintained high functionality and usability while optimizing development time.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancement

**Team size:** 5  
**Total planned enhancements:** 10

This section lists planned enhancements to address known feature flaws. These enhancements will be implemented after PE-D testing is completed and feedback is received.


1. **Enhance error messages for commands that use `INDEX`**  
   **Current Issue:** The error message associated with an invalid `INDEX` contains the line `Also possible: unknown prefixes added after person index`, which may be confusing for commands that accept no prefixes. (e.g. `delete`, `info`)  
   **Planned Enhancement:** Make the error message more specific, to only include the portion on unknown prefixes for commands that accept prefixes.
   

2. **Make 'undo' and 'redo' command limit clear**  
   **Current Issue:** Users are unaware of the limit to the `undo` and `redo` command history, leading to potential confusion.  
   **Planned Enhancement:** Display a warning when the maximum undo/redo history has been reached. For example, "No further undo actions are available."


3. **Emoji handling in input fields**  
   **Current Issue:** Input fields currently are not guaranteed to handle emojis correctly due to a regex limitation, which may cause unexpected behavior.  
   **Planned Enhancement:** Update the regex used for validation to allow emojis in names, addresses, and other text fields, or provide an informative error message if emojis are not supported.


4. **Display list sorting options**  
   **Current Issue:** The `list` command displays entries in a default order, with no options for sorting.  
   **Planned Enhancement:** Add sorting options to the `list` command, allowing users to sort by name, class, or payment status. For example, `list sortby/name` or `list sortby/class`.


5. **Enhance the `pie` and `bar` commands**  
   **Current Issue:** Currently, both commands generate a visualisation with fixed categories. (e.g. `pie` is fixed to only display `CLASS_ID`, and `bar` for `MONTH_PAID`)   
   **Planned Enhancement:** Allow users to specify the data they wish to make a pie/bar chart of. This will naturally solve edge cases for instances where the legend generated is empty, or empty strings are displayed as a bar on the bar chart.


6. **Allow multiple class allocations for a single student**  
   **Current Issue:** Currently, there are restrictions preventing a student from being assigned to more than one class, which can cause issues in managing class rosters.  
   **Planned Enhancement:** Add additional features that accommodates assigning each student to more than one class (i.e. replace the class ID implementation with a different implementation).


7. **Enable multi-word search for accurate matching**  
   **Current Issue:** Currently, the find command interprets multi-word entries with spaces (e.g., names or addresses) as separate search terms. For example, searching `n/Kim Woo Bin` returns any entries that match `Kim`, `Woo`, or `Bin` individually rather than finding the exact phrase `Kim Woo Bin`. Similarly, searching for an address like `222 Greenwood Ave` matches `222`, `Greenwood`, and `Ave` separately, which could yield inaccurate results.  
   **Planned Enhancement:** Modify the find command to recognize multi-word search terms as complete phrases, enabling accurate matching for entries that include spaces. This enhancement will help avoid potential edge cases due to whitespace handling.


8. **Enable distinction between parent and personal numbers**  
   **Current Issue:** Currently, each student in EduTuTu can only store up to one phone number.  
   **Planned Enhancement:** Modify EduTuTu to allow storage of multiple phone numbers (eg., Parent's Hp and Personal Phone Numbers)


9. **Enable handling of larger fees**  
   **Current Issue:** Currently, the fees field only accepts up to 9 integers to prevent integer overflow.  
   **Planned Enhancement:** Modify EduTuTu to allow the storage of larger fees & fees in the form of floats.


10. **Enable handling for more special characters in names**  
    **Current Issue:** Users may encounter issues when entering names with comma.  
    **Planned Enhancement:** Modify EduTuTu to allow the storage of names with more special characters.
 
These planned enhancements aim to improve usability, data validation, and user feedback within EduTuTu, addressing known issues while maintaining a smooth user experience.
