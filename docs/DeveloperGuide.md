### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete contact 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `JobListPanel`, `CompanyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person`, `Job` and `Company` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete contact 1")` API call as an example.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** In the diagram below, we see that the command `delete contact 1` causes the function `deletePerson(p)` to be invoked. In fact, `Person` is our class implementation for contacts. For the rest of this document, please note that "person" and "contact" are used interchangeably to refer to the same thing.
</div>

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete contact 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person`, `Job`, and `Company` objects 
(which are contained in a `UniquePersonList`, `UniqueJobList`, and `UniqueCompanyList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person`, `Job`, and `Company` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a 
separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`, 
`ObservableList<Job>`, and `ObservableList<Company>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list 
so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, 
they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

[//]: # (Not sure what to do with the diagram and text below)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Skill` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Skill` object per unique skill, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Skill` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   2. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a contact

1. Deleting a contact while all contacts are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all contacts using the `list contact` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   2. Test case: `delete contact 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message.

   3. Test case: `delete contact 0`<br>
      Expected: No contact is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   4. Test case: `delete contact x` (where x is larger than the contact list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

   5. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete test ...` <br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.


### Match a contact to a job listing

1. Matching a contact to a job listing while all contacts and job are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all contacts using the `list contact` command and list all job listings using the `list job` command. Each list has at least one entry.

    2. Test case: `match 1 1`<br>
       Expected: First contact from the list is match to first job listing from the list. Details of the matched contact and job listing shown in the status message.

    3. Test case: `match 1`<br>
       Expected: No contact and job listing are matched. Error details shown in the status message.

    4. Test case: `match 0 1`<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

    5. Test case: `match x 1` (where x is larger than the contact list size)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

    6. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `match`, `match contact 1` <br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. To simulate a corrupted file, you could add the word `Hello World!` in any contact's phone field in the JSON file. <br>
      Expected: The app detected corrupted file and start with an empty address book.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

* **Improve `screen job` functionality**: Currently, this command is only able to screen contacts that have roles which is a sub-string of the job name. 
We plan to expand on this functionality by allowing users to add parameters to modify the criteria used in the screening process or to specify how strict the screening is. 
Examples include to screen by skills of contacts and requirements for the job, or to allow filtering of contacts whose roles contain partial elements of the job name.
* **Enable support for job quota for `Job`**
* **Enable support for more billing date formats (from end of month)**
* **Enable support for `find job`**:   
* **Enable support for `find company`**  
* **Enable support for `edit job`**  
* **Enable support for `edit company`**  
* **Improve `help` functionality**: Display a list of commands together with the link to the documentation website.
* **Improve `list` functionality**: Enable option to only show unmatched contacts and jobs who aren't filled yet (after quota)
