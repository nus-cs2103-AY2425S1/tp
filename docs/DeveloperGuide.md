## 2. Design

### 2.1 Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#3-2-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#3-3-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#3-4-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#3-5-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#3-6-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

***

### 2.2 UI Component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g., `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in the [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml) file.

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands and update the UI state accordingly.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

The activity diagram below represents the flow of actions within the UI based on user commands, illustrating how the display is adjusted depending on the command's impact on the UI state.

<puml src="diagrams/UiActivityDiagram.puml" alt="Workflow of Updating the UI State"/>

***

### 2.3 Logic Component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

***

### 2.4 Model Component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="750" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

***

### 2.5 Storage Component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="750" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

***

### 2.6 Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## 3. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features and parameters are implemented. For all examples
below, the user is the tuition teacher, unless specified otherwise.

### 3.1 Lesson Time Parameter
This parameter allows users to keep track of a student's lesson timings. Multiple lesson times can be added for a single student.

#### 3.1.1 Design Considerations
**Treatment of clashing timings**
- **Current Implementation (Alternative 1):**
    - **Description**: Clashing lesson timings are permitted across all students and within each student's schedule.
    - **Pros**: Provides greater user flexibility, allowing all specified timings to be stored in EduManage, even if they overlap.
      Suitable for accommodating different schedules for alternate weeks or varying lesson arrangements.
    - **Cons**: Incorrect or conflicting lesson timings are not flagged out to the user, which could lead to scheduling confusion.

- **Alternative 2:**
    - **Description**: Clashing lesson timings are rejected across all students and within each student's schedule.
    - **Pros**: Ensures that incorrect or conflicting timings are flagged, helping the user avoid scheduling errors.
    - **Cons**: Reduces flexibility for users who need to store complex schedules with occasional overlapping times.

**Association between lesson timings and subjects**
- **Current Implementation (Alternative 1):**
    - **Description**: Each lesson timing is not associated with any subject.
    - **Pros**: Promotes greater user flexibility, allowing users to adjust subject focus within each lesson as needed.
      Suitable for scenarios where multiple subjects may be covered in a single lesson.
    - **Cons**: Users might prefer to have the association made clear.

- **Alternative 2:**
    - **Description**: Associate each lesson timing with a specific subject.
    - **Pros**: Clarifies what subject is to be taught during each lesson, helping users stay organised.
    - **Cons**: Reduces user flexibility in arranging lesson times for different subjects.

***

### 3.2 Add Feature
The Add feature allows users to register a new student in EduManage with a range of details, such as name, phone number, emergency contact, address, level, subject(s), and lesson time(s). Users can specify a single level, multiple subjects, and multiple lesson timings per student to tailor profile details for academic tracking and scheduling.

- **Duplicate Prevention**: If a student with identical details already exists, EduManage will prevent the addition and
  notify the user with an error message.
- **Level and Subject Compatibility**: When specified, the level and subjects are validated to ensure compatibility,
  helping to avoid entry errors.
- **Flexible Optional Fields**: Fields like level, subject, and lesson time are optional, providing flexibility in the
  amount of detail added for each student.

#### 3.2.1 Implementation - Activity Diagram
The activity diagram below highlights the various decision points during the process of adding a student, including
checks for valid command formats, parameter validity, matching subjects and levels, and whether the student already
exists in EduManage. If all checks pass, the student is successfully added to the EduManage, and the user receives a
success message. If any check fails, the user is notified with an appropriate error message.

<puml src="diagrams/AddActivityDiagram.puml" alt="AddActivityDiagram" />

#### 3.2.2 Design Considerations
**Centralized Validation in Subject Class**
- **Current Implementation (Alternative 1)**:
    - **Description**: Validation logic within the Subject class ensures that the list of valid subjects by level remains consistent. This makes it straightforward to update validation rules or allowed subjects.
    - **Pros**: Modularizes validation, reducing the complexity of AddCommand and providing reusable validation logic within Subject. 
    - **Cons**: Slightly increases the dependency on Subject for the AddCommand, but this trade-off is mitigated by improved maintainability.

- **Alternative 2**
    - **Description**: If validation were split between the AddCommand and Subject, each class would handle part of the validation. 
    - **Pros**: Reduces coupling between classes. 
    - **Cons**: Results in code duplication and reduced cohesion, complicating future changes in validation rules.

***

### 3.3 Tag Feature
This feature allows users to tag a student's profile with specific details related to school level (e.g., `S1 NA`) and
subject(s) (e.g., `MATH`). By entering the student's name and specifying tags for level or subject(s) (or both), users can
manage student profiles more efficiently.

- **Adding Multiple Tags**: Users can specify multiple subject tags and one level tag for a student. Each time tags are
  added, they will override any previously existing tags on the profile, ensuring that only the latest tags are retained.
- **Clearing of Tags**: Users can remove all tags from a student's profile by entering l/NONE s/NONE, which effectively
  resets both level and subject tags, leaving the profile with no active tags.
- **Invalid Input**: If an invalid student name, level, or subject is inputted, EduManage displays the constraints and
  guidelines for tag parameters. Additionally, if there is a mismatch between the tagged subjects and the specified level,
  an error message will highlight the incompatibility.
- **Case Insensitivity**: Tags are designed to be case-insensitive. If users add multiple tags that are equivalent in
  value (e.g., `Math` and `MATH`), only one instance of each unique tag will be added, preventing unnecessary
  duplication.

#### 3.3.1 Implementation - Sequence Diagrams
The sequence diagrams below depicts the interaction among various classes during the execution of a tag command.

<puml src="diagrams/TagSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="TagSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `TagCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

<puml src="diagrams/TagSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="TagSequenceDiagram-Model" />

#### 3.3.2 Design Considerations
**Parsing Tag Input**
- **Current Implementation (Alternative 1):**
    - **Description**: Tag validation is managed by the `ParserUtil` class, centralizing validation logic for improved
      maintainability and modularity.
    - **Pros**: By isolating validation in `ParserUtil`, updates and modifications are easier to manage, promoting a
      consistent approach across commands.
    - **Cons**: Adds a layer of abstraction, which may slightly increase EduManage’s complexity.

- **Alternative 2**:
    - **Description**: Validation occurs directly within `TagCommandParser`.
    - **Pros**: Keeps validation localized within the tag command, reducing dependencies on external classes.
    - **Cons**: Creates inconsistency across the codebase, making validation logic less reusable and harder to maintain.

**Design of Tag Constraints**
- **Current Implementation (Alternative 1)**:
    - **Description**: Tags are restricted to pre-defined values, and they are case-insensitive (e.g., `S1 NA` and
      `s1 na` are treated as identical, and `math` and `MATH` are treated as identical).
    - **Pros**: Enforces a standardized format for tags, ensuring brevity and uniformity.
    - **Cons**: Reduces user flexibility in customizing tags.

- **Alternative 2**:
    - **Description**: Users can create tags without specific constraints.
    - **Pros**: Provides greater flexibility for users to create custom tags.
    - **Cons**: Increases complexity in managing and validating user input, potentially leading to errors and inconsistencies.

***

### 3.4 View Specific Student Feature

This feature allows users to view the details of an existing student by specifying their name. It enables quick access
to a student's profile for viewing key information.

- **Viewing a Student's Profile**: Users can enter a student's name to view the corresponding details. EduManage will
  search for the student by name and display their profile if found.
- **Invalid Input**: If an invalid or non-existent student name is entered, EduManage will show an error message
  indicating that the student was not found.
- **Case Insensitivity**: EduManage treats student names case-insensitively, ensuring that variations in capitalization
  do not affect the search result.

#### 3.4.1 Implementation - Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram below depicts the interaction among various classes during the execution of a view command.

<puml src="diagrams/ViewSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ViewSequenceDiagram" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ViewCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

#### 3.4.2 Design Considerations
**Case Insensitivity and Name Matching**
- **Current Implementation (Alternative 1)**:
    - **Description**: Ignore cases when matching student names, ensuring that capitalization does not affect
      the search.
    - **Pros**: More flexible and user-friendly, as users do not have to match the exact case of the student's name.
    - **Cons**: Slight overhead in handling case conversion for name matching.

- **Alternative 2**:
    - **Description**: Require exact capitalization of the student's name for a match.
    - **Pros**: Ensures that no unnecessary case conversion is needed, which may slightly improve performance.
    - **Cons**: Increases the likelihood of user errors if the name is not entered exactly as stored.

***

### 3.5 Add Task Feature

This feature allows users to add specific tasks to a student's profile, enhancing the ability to track individual
assignments, exams, or goals for each student. By entering the student's name, task description and due date, users
can manage and monitor students' progress more efficiently.

- **Adding Multiple Tasks**: Users can add multiple tasks to a student. If a task with identical parameters already
  exists in the student's task list, an error message will alert the user, avoiding duplicate entries.
- **Invalid Input**: If an invalid student name, task description or due date is provided, EduManage displays the
   constraints and guidelines for the incorrect parameter(s).
- **Fixed Date Format**: Due dates must be entered in a strict `YYYY-MM-DD` format. This format avoids ambiguity and
  enforces consistency, helping users easily interpret task deadlines.

#### 3.5.1 Implementation - Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram below illustrate the interactions among various classes when an add task command is executed.

<puml src="diagrams/AddTaskSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="AddTaskSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AddTaskCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

#### 3.5.2 Design Considerations
**Parsing Task Input**
- **Current Implementation (Alternative 1)**:
    - **Description**: The `ParserUtil` class manages validation for task attributes, including date format checking,
      centralizing the logic for better maintainability.
    - **Pros**: Centralized validation supports consistency and simplifies updates to validation logic across multiple
      commands. 
    - **Cons**: Adds a layer of abstraction, which can make the code slightly more complex to trace.

- **Alternative 2**:
    - **Description**: Validation occurs directly within `AddTaskCommandParser`. 
    - **Pros**: Reduces dependency on external utility classes, keeping the validation logic localized within the
      command parser. 
    - **Cons**: Leads to code duplication across commands, making maintenance and updates more challenging.
  
**Design of Task Constraints**
- **Current Implementation (Alternative 1)**:
    - **Description**: Tasks require a strict `YYYY-MM-DD` date format for due dates.
    - **Pros**: Enforces a standardized format, making dates easy to read, parse, and sort chronologically.
    - **Cons**: Limits flexibility, as users cannot input custom date formats.

- **Alternative 2**:
    - **Description**: Users may enter due dates in a flexible format. 
    - **Pros**: Increases flexibility, accommodating different date formats. 
    - **Cons**: Adds complexity in validation and interpretation, potentially leading to errors or inconsistencies in task display.

## 7. Appendix: Planned Enhancements

Given below are the planned enhancements for future versions of EduManage.

**Team size**: 5.

### 7.1 Cumulative Updates for Subjects and Lesson Times

Currently, both subjects and lesson times are not updated cumulatively; using the `update` command replaces all previous
entries with the new values provided. This behavior can be inconvenient, especially when users want to add additional
subjects or lesson times without removing existing ones. We plan to enhance this feature to allow cumulative updates to
both subjects and lesson times, enabling users to add new subjects and lesson times without overwriting existing entries
by changing the behaviour of the `update` command.

***

### 7.2 Support for Special Characters in Names

Currently, only alphanumeric names are allowed. Users are advised to omit special characters (e.g., `,`, `-`, `/`) or replace them with spaces.
A future version will include support for names with special characters to accommodate a wider range of naming conventions.

***

### 7.3 Handling Multiple Students with Identical Names

Currently, EduManage does not support multiple students with identical names. As a workaround, users can differentiate these
students by adding numbering to their names (e.g., "John Doe 1," "John Doe 2"). We plan to accommodate this in the future by
relying on `INDEX` instead of `n/NAME` or `NAME` for commands.

***

### 7.4 Restriction on Using Reserved Prefixes within Parameters

Currently, EduManage does not check whether reserved prefixes are used within parameters. A future version will ensure that
all reserved prefixes are restricted from use in any parameters to prevent conflicts or unexpected behavior. This planned
enhancement aims to improve system reliability by reducing potential errors arising from misuse of reserved prefixes.

The reserved prefixes are: `a/`, `e/`, `lt/`, `l/`, `n/`, `nt/`, `p/`, `s/`, `d/`, `t/`, `ti/`.

***

### 7.5 Remove Note Display if Blank

Currently, notes are displayed even if they are left blank, which creates unnecessary clutter in the user interface.
In a future update, we aim to enhance the note display feature by automatically hiding it when no content is present,
providing a cleaner and more efficient user experience by removing unnecessary elements.

***

### 7.6 Autoscale Student List When Manually Adjusting Size
Currently, when users adjust the size of the student list window, the content does not automatically rescale, leading to
potential readability and usability issues. A future version will include an autoscaling feature for the student list,
ensuring that content dynamically adjusts to fit the window's new size. This enhancement will improve the flexibility
and adaptability of the user interface.

***

### 7.7 Restrict Task Deadlines to Dates After the Current Date
Currently, task deadlines can be set to dates in the past, which can lead to unintentional errors and confusion for
users. In an upcoming version, we plan to restrict task deadlines so that they can only be set to dates in the near
future (maximum of 1 year from the current date). This restriction will enhance user experience by ensuring that all
task deadlines are relevant and achievable.

***

### 7.8 Allow Lesson Times to Span Across Multiple Days
At present, lesson times are restricted to a single day, which can be limiting for scheduling. We plan to enhance the
scheduling feature to support lesson times that span multiple days, enabling users to create more flexible and realistic
lesson schedules. This feature will accommodate the needs of users with extended or multi-day lessons.
