## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/architecture/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletes n/John Doe`.

<puml src="diagrams/architecture/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class, which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java).

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

`AttendanceWindow` and `AttendanceRow` are separate classes from the main UI, which are used to display the attendance of students in a class.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

**`AttendanceWindow` Class**

The `AttendanceWindow` Class represents a window displaying the attendance records of students in a specific tutorial group. It,
* depends on the `Logic` component, as they need to execute commands to update the attendance.
* depends on the `Model` component, as they need to access the `Student` objects to display the attendance.
* listens for changes to the `Model` data so that the table view can be refreshed and updated with the modified data.


**`AttendanceRow` Class**

The `AttendanceRow` class represents a single row in the attendance table, displaying a student's name and attendance status for each date. It,
* depends on the `Model` component, as they need to access the `Student` objects to display the attendance.
* listens for changes to the `Model` data so that the row can be refreshed and updated with the modified data.

Each `AttendanceRow` is updated in real-time as the underlying attendance records are modified, allowing the UI to maintain up-to-date attendance statuses for each student.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("view Diddy")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `view Diddy` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ViewStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X,) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues until the end of the diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `WXYZCommandParser` (`WXYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `WXYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `WXYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible, e.g during testing.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" width = "150"/>

How the undo works:
* When any command that is not undo is called, the `LogicManger` pushes the command onto the `CommandStack`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" width = "150"/>

* When the `undo` command is called, the `LogicManager` pops the latest command. 

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" width = "150"/>


### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/model/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<box type="info" seamless>

<puml src="diagrams/model/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Planned Enhancements

1. View `Students` by their associative tags (e.g `Tutorial Group`, `Assignments`)
2. View `Assignment` Details
3. Modify `Grade` details to be case-insensitive
4. Modify `View` Command's parameters to be case-insensitive 
5. Prevent duplicate `Phone` numbers from being assigned to more than 1 `Student`.
6. Allow `Names` to include special characters
7. Find `Students` who have yet to submit `Assignments`
8. Limit the length of inputs to prevent truncation errors 
9. Add timestamp to `Deadline` for `Assignment`
10. Add Start Date and End Date to `Assignment`

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Codebase should be _modular_ and easy to update, so that future developers can easily add new features or fix bugs.
5.  App should have the ability to gracefully handle a data file that is corrupted without crashing, and inform the user of the issue.
6.  System should _gracefully recover_ from minor errors (e.g., incorrect or incomplete input) by either prompting the user to correct the issue, or using default values where applicable.
7.  System should have well-written and accessible user and developer documentation to support both end-users and future developers in using and maintaining the application.
8.  System should have a comprehensive suite of automated tests to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
9.  System should implement a _data retention policy_, ensuring that data and records older than a certain period are archived or deleted to optimize performance and comply with legal requirements.
10. System should have easy-to-use backup and restore functionality, enabling users to create backups of their data, and restore their data in the event of data loss or corruption.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Modular**: Codebase is divided into separate parts that can be updated without affecting other parts.
* **Gracefully recover**: Provides an appropriate solution without crashing the application.
* **Data retention policy**: Guidelines regarding what data should be kept, how long data should be kept and more.
* **CLI - interface**: Any application that mainly takes in input via text, not necessarily through a command console.
* **Privacy**: Personal details that are not meant to be shared with others.
* **Automated Tests** : Tests that are run automatically to ensure that the application is working as expected.

## **Appendix: Instructions for Manual Testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</box>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    1. Launch the jar using the java -jar command. <br>
       Expected: Shows the GUI with no contacts currently. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    1. Re-launch the app by using the java -jar command.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.



### Deleting a student

1. Deleting a student while all students are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all students using the `list` command. The student uniquely named `John Doe` is in the list, but not the student `Jane`.

    1. Test case: `deletes n/John Doe`<br>
       Expected: `John Doe` is deleted from the list. The name and student number of the deleted contact are shown in the status message. 

    1. Test case: `deletes n/Jane`<br>
       Expected: No student is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. State of command box remains the same, i.e. the command that was typed in remains in the command box.

    1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `deletes`, `deletes x/`, `...` (where x is any invalid prefix)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous case.

### Marking attendance for a tutorial group
1. Marking attendance for a mostly-present tutorial group (2 - 3 Students absent)

   1. Prerequisites: The tutorial group `T01` is added to a class worth of students. The students `John Doe` and `Jane Doe` are in the tutorial group. 
   
   2. Test case: `markpresentall tg/T01 dt/2025-01-20` &rarr; `markat n/John Doe dt/2025-01-20 pr/a` &rarr;  `markat n/Jane Doe dt/2025-01-20 pr/a` &rarr; `getattg tg/T01` <br>
    Expected: On the date column `Jan 20 2025`, all students in the tutorial group `T01` are marked `present`, except for `John Doe` and `Jane Doe` who are marked `absent`. The status message shows the name of the last `Tutorial Group`'s attendances that were shown.
   
   3. Test Case: `markpresentall tg/T11 dt/2025-01-20` <br>
    Expected: The tutorial group `T11` does not exist. Error message shown in the status message. State of command box remains the same, i.e. the command that was typed in remains in the command box.
   
   4. Other incorrect mark commands to try: `markpresentall`, `markpresentall x/ x/`, `markat`, `markat x/ x/ x/`, `...` (where x is any invalid prefix) <br>
    Expected: Similar to previous case.



2. Marking Attendance for a mostly-absent Tutorial Group (2 - 3 Students present).

   1. Prerequisites: The `Tutorial Group` `T02` is added to a class' worth of students. The Students `John Doe` and `Jane Doe` are in the tutorial group.

   2. Test case: `markabsentall tg/T02 dt/2025-01-20` &rarr; `markat n/John Doe dt/2025-01-20 pr/p` &rarr; `markat n/Jane Doe dt/2025-01-20 pr/p` &rarr; `getattg tg/T02`<br>
   Expected: On the date column `Jan 20 2025`, all students in the tutorial group `T02` are marked `absent`, except for `John Doe` and `Jane Doe` who are marked `present`. The status message shows the name of the last `Tutorial Group`'s attendances that were shown.

   3. Test case: `markabsentall tg/T11`<br>
   Expected: The tutorial group `T11` does not exist. Error message shown in the status message. State of command box remains the same, i.e. the command that was typed in remains in the command box.
 
   4. Other incorrect mark commands to try: `markabsentall`, `markabsentall x/ x/`, `markat`, `markat x/ x/ x/`, `...` (where x is any invalid prefix) <br>
   Expected: Similar to previous case

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

### List students by other fields

Currently, users may only list students by name. We plan to expand this to include other relevant fields such as tutorial group and assignments

### View assignment details

Currently, users cannot view assignment deadlines. We plan to implement a feature which can allow users to view assignment details.

### Input for grade is case-sensitive

Currently, the input for grade is case-sensitive which may be inconvenient for the user. We plan to make the input for grade case-insensitive.

### Input for name in `view` is case-sensitive

Currently, the input for name in `view` is case-sensitive which may be inconvenient for the user. We plan to make the input for name in `view` case-insensitive. 

### Prevent duplicate phone numbers.

Currently, users can input duplicate phone numbers for different students. This is likely to be an error from the user and we plan to prompt the user about this error in the future.

### Allow names to include certain special characters.

Currently, names can only contain alphanumeric characters and characters like '/' are not allowed. We plan to allow characters like '/' to allow a wider range of names to be entered.

### Sort the displayed list of students

Currently, there is no way to sort the displayed list of students. We plan to add ways for the user to sort the displayed list of students (e.g. sorting by number of ungraded assignment)

### Limit the length of inputs

Currently, entering extremely large inputs may cause the UI to truncate the display of these fields. Inputs beyond a reasonable length are likely an error. We plan to limit the length of input to prevent truncation errors.

### Increase specificity of deadline

Currently, deadlines do not have a timestamp. We plan to allow deadlines to include a timestamp.

### Track submission dates for assignments

Currently, assignment does not track its associated submission date. We plan to allow users to input a relevant submission date.
