## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the application.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/eventtory/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/eventtory/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the application launch and shut down.
* At application launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the application's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the application.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the application in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete v/1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/eventtory/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component" width="800" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The `UiPart` class that UI components inherit from was removed from the class diagram to reduce clutter.

</box>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `VendorListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts is defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/eventtory/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Vendor` and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/eventtory/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete e/1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete e/1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of the diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `EventToryParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteEventCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete an event).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `EventToryParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CreateCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CreateVendorCommand`) which the `EventToryParser` returns as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CreateCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g., during testing.

How commands work:
* `XYZEventCommand` and `XYZVendorCommand` classes (e.g., `CreateEventCommand`, `CreateVendorCommand`, ...) inherit from their respective abstract classes (e.g., `CreateCommand`).
* `ClearCommand`, `HelpCommand`, `ExitCommand`, `AssignCommand`, and `UnassignCommand` do not have corresponding `XYZEventCommand` and `XYZVendorCommand` classes.
* `ListCommand` is not an abstract class.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/eventtory/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="640" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note** To reduce visual clutter, auxiliary classes within the `Vendor`, `Event`, and `Association` classes have been omitted from the diagram.

</box>


The `Model` component,

* stores EventTory data i.e., all `Vendor`, `Model`, and `Association` objects
* contains observables that can be 'observed' by outsiders e.g. the UI can be bound to a `UiState` state so that the UI automatically changes the screen when the data in `UiState` changes, such as:
    * the current displayed `UiState` as an `ObjectProperty<UiState>` object
    * the current selected (if any) `Event`, `Vendor` objects for viewing as separate `ObjectProperty<Event>`, `ObjectProperty<Vendor>` objects
    * the current selected `Event`, `Vendor` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
    * the current trailing index offset for assigned vendors/events in view mode as an `ObservableIntegerValue` object
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/eventtory/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both EventTory data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `EventToryStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`, for examples, see the JsonAdapted classes eg. `JsonAdaptedVendor`, `JsonAdapterEvent`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.eventtory.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Assign and Unassign Commands

The assign command adds the ability for the user to assign a vendor to an event and vice versa when inside the detailed view for either an `Event` or `Vendor`.

Given below is a usage scenario for the `assign` and `unassign` commands:

Step 1. Enter the details view for either an `Event` or a `Vendor`. For example, `view v/1` to view the first vendor.

Step 2. Assign the first `Event` from the list of assignable events to the currently viewed `Vendor`, using the command `assign 1`. The `Event` should now be shifted from the list of assignable events to the list of assigned events.

Step 3. To unassign the `Event` from the vendor, use the command `unassign 1`. The `Event` should now be shifted from the list of assigned events to the list of assignable events.

The `AssignCommand` and `UnassignCommand` classes were introduced to represent these commands. To support parsing the arguments to both commands, the `AssignCommandParser` and `UnassignCommandParser` classes were added.

For better understanding, refer to the sequence diagram below which illustrates the execution of the `assign` command. The first sequence diagram shows what happens when a user enters the assign command:

<puml src="diagrams/AssignParserSequenceDiagram.puml" width="800" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `AssignCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of the diagram.

</box>

During the execution of the command itself, the behaviour of the command depends on the current view of the user, as shown in the following sequence diagram:

<puml src="diagrams/AssignSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" />

#### Changes to Model

Implementing these commands required significant changes to the `Model` of the application, details of which are covered in this section:

* A unique identifier for both the `Event` and `Vendor` classes was added. This is represented by the new `UniqueId` class, which makes use of Java's built-in UUID class.
* The `Association` class represents pairs of assigned events and vendors, which is done using a pair of `UniqueId` classes, taken from the respective `Event` and `Vendor` instances.
* The list of associations in the current application's state are stored in the `UniqueAssociationList` class, which enforces a unique constraint on the `Association` instances stored within it.

The following methods to support the `assign` and `unassign` commands were implemented in `EventTory`:

* `EventTory#getAssociatedVendors(Event)` â€” Get the list of vendors associated to the provided event.
* `EventTory#getAssociatedEvents(Vendor)` â€” Get the list of events associated to the provided vendor.
* `EventTory#assignVendorToEvent(Vendor, Event)` â€” Create an association between the given `Vendor` and `Event`, and updates the list of associations.
* `EventTory#unassignVendorFromEvent(Vendor, Event)` â€” Remove the association between the given `Vendor` and `Event`, and updates the list of associations.
* `EventTory#getAssociationList()` â€” Get the full list of associations.
* `EventTory#isVendorAssignedToEvent(Vendor, Event)` â€” Returns a boolean indicating whether an association exists between a given `Vendor` and `Event`.
* `EventTory#setAssociations(List<Association>)` â€” Sets the state of the association list to the provided list.

We also expose the following methods in the `Model` interface, exposing the same operations as the `EventTory` class:

* `Model#getAssociatedVendors(Event)`
* `Model#getAssociatedEvents(Vendor)`
* `Model#assignVendorToEvent(Vendor, Event)`
* `Model#unassignVendorFromEvent(Vendor, Event)`
* `Model#getAssociationList()`
* `Model#isVendorAssignedToEvent(Vendor, Event)`

#### Changes to Storage

To support data persistence, `JsonAdaptedAssociation` was implemented to allow storing the list of associations alongside `Vendor` and `Event` information. In storage data, the list of associations are represented in the following form:

```
"associations": [
  {
    "vendorId": "a1e2c3d4-5f67-4890-8a1b-123456789abc",
    "eventId": "a1e2c3d4-5f67-4890-8a1b-123456789abd"
  },
  {
    "vendorId": "b2f3d4e5-6a78-491a-9b2c-23456789abcd",
    "eventId": "b2e3c4d5-6f78-49a1-9b2c-23456789abcd"
  }
]
```

In the case where the UUID strings are not valid UUID strings or do not correspond to real vendors or events, the whole JSON document representing the data will be treated as invalid.

#### Exception Handling

Adding this command into EventTory introduced new edge cases that had to be handled as well. Their details are covered in this section:

When deleting a `Vendor` or `Event` using the `delete` command, we have to make sure that it is not currently assigned to any other item. Otherwise, this would lead to the application storing associations between items that no longer exist. To handle this, the `AssociationDeleteException` was added to inform the user if they are trying to delete an item that is currently assigned to another item.

Since associations are meant to be unique, the `DuplicateAssociationException` was also added to inform the user, if they attempt to assign a pair of events and vendors that have already been assigned to each other.

To handle the event where the user attempts to unassign a vendor from an event when there is no existing association between the 2 items, the `AssociationNotFoundException` is used.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Individuals responsible for planning and managing events who need to communicate with multiple vendors concurrently.

Examples:
* corporate event managers
* wedding planners
* social event coordinators.

User Characteristics:
* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts and events
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* can type fast
* is comfortable using Command-Line Interface (CLI) applications

**Value proposition**:

EventTory simplifies the process of organizing events, from small gatherings to large-scale corporate functions, and is optimized for users who prefer a CLI-like interface.

With the ability to track event details and contact information for various vendors, EventTory allows users to manage the status of multiple events with ease.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 100 events and 100 vendors without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  Should be able to assign up to 100 vendors to an event without any issues.
4.  A user with an above-average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
5.  Persistent data stored by the system should be in a human-readable format.

### Glossary

1. **Alias:** An alternate version of a command that can be used in place of the original. Is likely shorter than the original command.

2. **Autocomplete:** A feature that suggests possible completions of a partially typed command.

3. **Command:** A text input entered by the user to perform a specific function/action (e.g., create an event, assign a vendor).

4. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** A text-based user interface where users interact with the system by typing commands instead of using graphical elements.

5. **Event:** A scheduled occasion or activity, such as a wedding, corporate function, or social gathering.

6. **Mainstream OS:** Commonly used operating systems including Windows, Linux, Unix, and macOS.

7. **Progress Status:** An indicator that tracks the completion level of a vendor's deliverables for an event.

8. **Tag:** A label or keyword assigned to vendors or events to facilitate filtering and searching.

9. **Vendor:** A service provider, such as a caterer, photographer, or decorator, who is employed for events.

10. **Item**: Refers to any entity or object that can be viewed or deleted within the system, such as an event or vendor.

11. **Associated Entities**: Refers to any related items or dependencies connected to the main item. For example, for an event, associated entities include assigned vendors; for a vendor, associated entities include assigned events.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**
### Name similarity warning
Notifies users when creating vendors or events with names similar to existing ones. If a user attempts to add a new vendor or event with a potentially matching name, the system alerts them to existing similar entries, prompting confirmation or suggesting alternative naming options.

### Description fields for events
Introduce a description field for each event, allowing users to add more detailed notes about the event's context, objectives, special requirements, or unique features.

### Association note
Allow users to add a short note to an association between a vendor and an event. This note can serve as a custom message or reminder specific to the event-vendor relationship, such as special instructions, deadlines, or contract details.

### Fine-grained find command
Enhance the find command to support searching within specific fields. Users can specify particular fields to search within, such as name, tag, or description. This feature will make finding items more precise and adaptable to different user needs.

### Bulk unassign
Enable users to unassign multiple vendors from an event or multiple events from a vendor in one command. This feature is especially helpful for clearing out old associations after an event concludes or for quickly reassigning vendors to different events.

### Enhanced Support for Foreign Phone Numbers
Improve the systemâ€™s ability to handle phone numbers in various international formats and with non-standard characters. This includes recognizing and storing diverse formats such as country codes, extensions, and special characters to accommodate a wider range of contact details. The current approach relies on users adding these specifiers without symbols or using tags to identify them, which can be confusing and cumbersome.

### Case Sensitivity for Commands
Make commands case-insensitive to allow users more input flexibility e.g. accidentally hitting the shift key midway through typing a command word.
* Current command words e.g. `create`, `list` require user inputs to be strictly lowercase.
* `lISt`, `List` or `LIST` would not be recognised as valid commands.
