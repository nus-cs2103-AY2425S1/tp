### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="1300"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.


<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="1200"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="650" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the event data in a `EventManager` object, which contains all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `EventList` object).
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="750" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, event manager data, and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `EventManagerStorage`, and `UserPrefsStorage`, meaning it can be treated as any of these (if only the functionality of one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Events: Adding Event
<img src="images/AddEventCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="1300" />

Above shows the sequence diagram when a user wants to add an event.
1. The user types the command `new EVENT_NAME`
2. Logic Manager receives the text input and passes it to addressBookParser
3. AddressBookParser creates a new NewEventCommandParser and calls its parse method
4. NewEventCommandParser creates a new AddEventCommand object, which is then passed back to Logic Manager
5. Logic Manager calls the execute method of the AddEventCommand object
6. AddEventCommand object calls the addEvent method of eventManager
7. AddEventCommand object returns a CommandResult object to Logic Manager

### **Planned Enhancements**
Team size: 5
1. **Clear Search Results in Search Mode**: Currently there is no way to clear existing search conditions in `search-mode`.
   This enhancement will add a command to allow users to clear the current search results and revert to the beginning of activating `search-mode` again.
2. **find-role search for users with no Roles**: Currently, the `find-role` command is unable to search for users with no roles.
   This enhancement will allow search for users with no roles.
3. **Top Level Domain (TLD) input validation for emails**: Currently, it is possible to create emails of `x@xx` format, even though 
   the domain part of the email should have at least 2 domain labels, the last one being the Top Level Domain (TLD) in
   real life (i.e. the minimal format should be `@xx.xx`). We could have better input validation to enforce that there must be at least 2 domain labels.
4. **Allow users to define custom roles for contacts**: Currently, contacts can only have attendee, sponsor, vendor and volunteer roles or have no roles, which may
   be too restrictive. We could allow users to add additional roles to contacts such as "emcee", "performer", "VIP" etc so that 
   they get a classification instead of being labelled as no roles just because they do not fit in one of the 4 pre-determined roles. These user defined roles
   will continue to work the same way as the 4 pre-determined roles.
5. **Search within an event**: Currently, all searches are done on the general list of contacts. We could expand `find-event` to include a search for contacts within an event
   e.g. find-event ei/1 n/john to find a contact with name "john" within event 1 so that users can find a contact for a specific event more quickly.
6. **Add description to event**: Currently, users are only able to create events with an event name. We could allow users to add
   description to events when they create a new event e.g. new n/EVENT_NAME d/EVENT_DESCRIPTION so that they can add additional important details like the date and location of the event.
7. **Make remove contact from event message more specific**: Currently, if user types "remove ei/1 ci/0", the app says "Invalid command format!
   remove ei/EVENT_INDEX ci/CONTACT_INDEX : Removes a contact from an event" which is not specific enough. We plan to make the error message say "Contact Index should be a positive integer" instead.
8. **Make event-add and add-all error message more specific and less misleading**: Currently, when "event-add" command or "add-all" command in search mode is called to add multiple contacts to an event at the same time, if one of the contacts to be added to event does not have the role that he or she is being added to,
   PlanPal shows an error message informing the user of the contact that does not have the role. However, some of the contacts may get added to the event. We plan to make the
   error message include which contacts got added to the event so that users know that certain contacts got added and which contacts did not get added to the event.
9. **Implement more graceful handling of invalid JSON data**: Currently, manual editing of JSON data is allowed. However, if invalid data is entered, the event list or address list could be completely cleared or the app 
   may fail unexpectedly. We plan to implement more graceful handling of invalid JSON data so that invalid data entries can be ignored, allowing for operation with the remaining valid data.
10. **Allow input fields to have longer length limits**: Currently, we limit the lengths of all the input fields such as event name,
    contact name, phone number, address and email to a reasonable limit such that they are visible within the UI. However, it is possible that there are rare cases where the
    length of real life information exceeds the input length limits we have imposed. We could allow greater input lengths by making our UI more robust in viewing
    inputs that are very lengthy.
