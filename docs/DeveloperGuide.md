### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in
charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name} Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `BuyerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)  

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Buyer`, `MeetUp` or `Property` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to the `AbcliParser` class.
2. The `AbcliParser` class then creates either a `BuyerCommandParser`, `MeetUpCommandParser`, or `PropertyCommandParser` according to its `currentMode`.
3. The created CommandParser then creates another parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command. The type of parser created here is dependent on the CommandParser created in step 2, e.g. a `MeetUpCommandParser` will create a `DeleteCommandParser` for the `MeetUp` class, while a `BuyerCommandParser` will create a `DeleteCommandParser` for the `Buyer` class.
4. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
5. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a buyer).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
6. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AbcliParser` class creates a `BMPCommandParser` (`BMP` is a placeholder for the different mode of parsers, either a `BuyerCommandParser`, `MeetUpCommandParser`, or `PropertyCommandParser`). The created `BMPCommandParser` then creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g. `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AbcliParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g. during testing.
* All `BMPCommandParser` classes (`BuyerCommandParser`, `MeetUpCommandParser`, and `PropertyCommandParser`) extends the `CommandParser` class so that all of them have access to general commands e.g. `HelpCommand`, `Exit Command`.

### Model component

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />  

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note**: This model class diagram is simplified for readability. The implementation of the `Buyer`, `MeetUp` and `Property` models are given below.  

<img src="images/BuyerMeetUpModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" /> <br>

<img src="images/PropertyModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />
</div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the buyer list data i.e., all `Buyer` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueBuyerList` object).
* stores the meet-up list data i.e. all `MeetUp` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueMeetUpList` object).
* stores the property list data i.e. all `Property` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePropertyList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Buyer` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Buyer>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `MeetUp` and `Property` objects in a similar fashion to the currently 'selected' `Buyer` objects.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save buyer list data, meetup list data, property list data, and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `BuyerListStorage`, `MeetUpListStorage`, `PropertyListStorage`, and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any of them (if only the
  functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.budget.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Parser Mode Switching

#### Implementation

User inputs are parsed through `AbcliParser` to create executable `Command` objects. The parsing done by `AbcliParser` is determined by its mode of parsing, which is either the Buyer mode, MeetUp mode, or Property mode. For example, in the Buyer mode, `AbcliParser` will create a `BuyerCommandParser` object to parse the input, and create a command that is of type `Buyer`.

The mode of `AbcliParser` can be switched by executing a `SwitchParserModeCommand`. An example of switching to the MeetUp mode:
1. User inputs `switch m`, which is then passed to the `AbcliParser` class.
2. The `AbcliParser` class then creates either a `BuyerCommandParser`, `MeetUpCommandParser`, or `PropertyCommandParser` according to its `currentMode`. (The default current mode is set to Buyer mode, and the type of `CommandParser` created here does not matter since all of them handle `SwitchParserModeCommand` the same way).
3. The created `CommandParser` then creates a `SwitchParserModeCommandParser` and uses it to parse the command.
4. This results in a `SwitchParserModeCommand` with the mode `ParserMode.MEETUP` which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
5. The `SwitchParserModeCommand` then switches the `currentMode` of `AbcliParser` to `ParserMode.MEETUP` when executed. The `currentMode` will affect the type of `CommandParser` that will be created for future parses (in step 2).
6. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The diagram below shows the activity diagram for a user wanting to delete the first `MeetUp` in his `MeetUpList`:<br><br>

## **Appendix: Product Details**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

A real estate agent who...

* has a need to manage a significant number of client contacts
* frequently needs to track client information such as their budget
* hopes to schedule and manage appointments with the clients
* hopes to ensure smooth communication with clients by sending updates on listings and appointment reminders
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Using CLI to streamline management of client contacts and communications will make it more
efficient than a typical mouse/GUI driven app

1. ABCLI should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.

1. ABCLI should be able to hold up to 1000 buyers without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.

1. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be
   able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

1. ABCLI should be targeting users who can type fast and prefer typing to other means of input.

1. ABCLI should be for a single user.

1. ABCLI needs to be developed in a breadth-first incremental manner over the project duration.

1. ABCLI's data should be stored locally and should be in a human editable text file.

1. ABCLI cannot use a DBMS to store data.

1. ABCLI should follow the Object-oriented paradigm primarily.

1. ABCLI should work on the Windows, Linux, and OS-X platforms.

1. ABCLI should work on a computer that has version 17 of Java.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar abcli.jar` command to run the application.  
    Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

1. Multiple launches

    1. Prerequisites: List all buyers using the `view` command. At least two buyers in the list.

    1. Launching the app two times by double-clicking the jar file twice.  
     Expected: A new instance of the application should open with each double click

    1. Execute `delete 1` on one of the opened application and close the application.

    1. Execute `delete 2` on the other opened application and close the application.

    1. Launch another instance of the application.  
    Expected: Second contact from the original buyer list is deleted but not the first. This is because if there are changes made to both instances of the application, only the changes made on the most recent application is saved.

1. Force close (unexpected shutdown)

    1. Prerequisites: List all buyers using the `view` command. At least one buyer in the list.
   
    1. Launching the app and execute `delete 1`.    
    Expected: A new instance of the application should open and running this command deletes the first contact from the buyer list.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Our team size is 5.

### Support for special characters in names
* We plan to add support for special characters in names such as Lupita Nyong'o, Adib S/O Tharman etc. This can be done by updating the validation regex to accept certain special characters.

### Restriction of property types
* Property types will be given restrictions in the future such that nonsensical types will not be accepted. We will create an `enum` with common types such as `HDB`, `Landed Property`, `Condominium` etc.

### Improved duplication detection
* Buyer duplication detection will be changed from the current method of checking for repeated names to checking for a repeated phone number OR email as these are better unique identifiers.


### Setting a maximum for budget and asking price
* Currently, there are no restrictions on the maximum value an asking price or budget can take. Therefore, the user can input unrealistic values such as 999,999,999,999. This also creates an issue of `long` overflow when the value is too large (exceeds `9223372036854775807`) as the application uses the `java.lang.Long.parseLong()` method. 
* A planned enhancement will be to use validation regex to ensure that the asking price and budget values are below a maximum, which can be set to 1,000,000,000.

### Find using more parameters
* `find` will be updated for all 3 modes to allow the use of more parameters (such as: `b/BUDGET`, `p/PHONE`, `e/EMAIL`, and `t/TAG` for buyers). We will change the `find` command to accept more types of parameters. 

## **Appendix: Glossary**
### Glossary
1. **ABCLI**  
Our product name.

1. **CLI**  
The command line interface is a way to interact with a computer by typing text commands instead of using a mouse to click on icons.

1. **Flag**  
In our context, a flag is something preceded by a `/`, but is not the initial command. e.g. in `add n/NAME`,  `n/` is a flag but `add` is not.

1. **GUI**  
Graphical user interface. The screen you see when opening the application.

1. **JAR file**  
A JAR (Java ARchive) file is a compressed package that bundles multiple Java classes and resources for easier distribution and deployment. It can also be executable if it contains a Main-Class entry, allowing it to be run directly on any system with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

1. **JavaFX**  
JavaFX is a Java library used to build rich, interactive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for desktop applications. It provides tools for designing and styling UI components and supports modern features like 2D/3D graphics, animation, and media playback.

1. **Non-Functional Requirement**  
A non-functional requirement specifies criteria that judge the operation of a system, such as performance, reliability, and usability. Unlike functional requirements, it focuses on how a system performs rather than what it does.

1. **Parameter**  
A value that you need to provide for the command to work. e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter.

1. **Plant UML**  
PlantUML is a tool that allows users to create diagrams, such as UML diagrams, by writing simple, text-based descriptions that are then converted into visual representations. It supports a range of diagrams—like class, sequence, and activity diagrams—and is often used to quickly illustrate system designs or workflows.

1. **Use Case**  
A use case describes a specific way that a user interacts with a system to achieve a goal, often outlining steps from start to finish. It helps clarify system requirements by detailing the actions, conditions, and outcomes for each interaction scenario.
