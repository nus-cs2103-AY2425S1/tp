### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="281" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `/e del 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="544"  alt=""/>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="314" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EventListPanel`, `VolunteerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Event` and `Volunteer` objects residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="534" alt=""/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("del 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteVolunteerSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `VolunteerDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `EventNewCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
    - For example, if it is a command that creates a new event (e.g. /e new), AddressBookParser creates an instance of `EventCommandParser`, which then creates the `EventNewCommandParser` to parse the command using other classes shown in the diagram below.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `EventNewCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to create a new event).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object, `Model` and other classes within the model package e.g `AddressBook`, `EventManager`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="668"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `EventCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above such as the EventParserUtil to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `EventNewCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `EventNewCommandParser`, `EventDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="488"  alt=""/>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Event` and `Volunteer` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` and `UniqueVolunteerList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'displayed' `Event` and `Volunteer` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` and `ObservableList<Volunteer` respectively, that can be 'observed'. (The UI is bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change e.g. due to additions or deletions.)
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="627"  alt=""/>

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the [`seedu.address.commons`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons) package.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Project Scope and Difficulty
This project was significantly more challenging than the Address Book 3 (AB3) reference project due to its broader scope and the complexity of managing multiple entity types. While AB3 focuses on a single entity type (Persons), our project, **VolunSync**, had to manage and integrate multiple entities such as **Volunteers** and **Events**. This increased the difficulty of implementing features such as assignment, scheduling, and cross-entity dependencies, requiring a robust data model and additional logic.

### Challenges Faced
- **Entity Relationships**: Implementing relationships between entities (e.g., assigning volunteers to events, tracking event participants) posed significant challenges, especially when ensuring data consistency and avoiding duplication.
- **User Experience**: Developing a command-line interface that is both intuitive and efficient for users with varying technical skills was a considerable effort.
- **Testing and Coverage**: Achieving high test coverage for a complex system with multiple interdependent features added to the project workload.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Effort Required
The project involved **approximately 1.5x the effort required for AB3**, primarily due to the increased complexity of handling multiple entities and implementing advanced features such as:
- Filtering of volunteers based on availability
- Volunteer assignment with availability (ensuring event is on a free day and that they have no overlapping assignments) checks.
- Listing information of volunteers involved in events and vice versa.
- Restructuring of UI to handle dynamic updating of information and new commands.

### Achievements
Despite the challenges, the team successfully:
- Developed a scalable and efficient system that meets the needs of nonprofit organizations.
- Achieved high test coverage for core functionalities.
- Implemented a user-friendly interface while maintaining fast response times for all operations.
- Added additional features like volunteer tracking and reporting, going beyond the base functionality of AB3.

### Reuse and Libraries
To save effort, the project reused several libraries, which provided critical functionality:
1. **JavaFX**: For building the graphical user interface. This significantly reduced the time required to implement the UI from scratch.
2. **Jackson**: For handling JSON serialization and deserialization, enabling faster development of the storage module.
3. **JUnit 5**: For unit testing, which streamlined the testing process and improved overall code quality.

For example, the **storage module** leverages Jackson for JSON parsing. Our work involved adapting Jackson to our specific data model (e.g., custom serializers/deserializers), as seen in classes like `JsonAdaptedVolunteer` and `JsonAdaptedEvent`. This saved an estimated **10-15% of effort** compared to building a storage parser from scratch.

### Conclusion
The project demonstrated a high level of effort and collaboration, resulting in a feature-rich and robust application that addresses the real-world challenges faced by nonprofit organizations. It serves as a testament to the teamâ€™s ability to deliver a product that is both scalable and user-focused.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team size: 5**

The following planned enhancements address known feature flaws identified during the PE-D phase. Each enhancement specifically describes the feature flaw and the proposed solution, providing details on how the feature will be improved. This section lists 3 planned enhancements, adhering to the team size x 2 limit.

1. **Allow Events To Span Multiple Days**
   - **Feature Flaw**: Currently events cannot span multiple days (e.g overnight events).
   - **Proposed Solution**: Events should be able to have multiple days with multiple start and end timings.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Users should be able to assign volunteers to all or some days of a multi-date event instead of and creating multiple events on each day and separately assign volunteers.

2. **Allow Volunteers To Only Be Free At Some Times Of Some Days**
   - **Feature Flaw**: Currently volunteers are assumed to be free for the whole day on their free days.
   - **Proposed Solution**: Volunteers should be able to have start and end timings for their free periods on free days. Event assignment should check for volunteer's free time as well as day.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Users should not need to manually check if the volunteer is free on a given event timing before assigning them to an event.

3. **Enhance Event List Sorting**
    - **Feature Flaw**: Events are currently displayed in the order they were added, making it difficult to find upcoming events.
    - **Proposed Fix**: Add sorting options to the event list, such as sorting by date, time, or location. Command example: `/e list sort/date`.
    - **Expected Outcome**: Improved usability for managing events.

4. **Enhance Find Command Input Flexibility**
    - **Feature Flaw**: Currently the find command does not support searching for email or phone number.
    - **Proposed Fix**: Update the search functionality to allow for searching email and phone number. For example, searching for `93456` will return `David Ng`.
    - **Expected Outcome**: More flexible search results.

5. **Dynamic UI Updates**
    - **Feature Flaw**: Unassign Volunteers from Events while viewing said event would still show volunteer is involved
    - **Proposed Fix**: UI would dynamically update the results it shows after every command is run.
    - **Expected Outcome**: UI would display accurate and the most updated information.

6. **Multiple Error Tracking**
    - **Feature Flaw**: Currently exceptions are thrown at the first error encountered from a user command. 
    - **Proposed Fix**: The error message should show all detectable errors with the command (e.g volunteer is assigned to multiple events on day User is trying to unfree, Volunteer has multiple clashing events for an assign command, etc).
    - **Expected Outcome**: Users would be able to as many issues as possible before re-entering the command without needing to check it one by one.

7. **Add Support For Leap Years**
    - **Feature Flaw**: Currently the date does not parse leap days accordingly
    - **Proposed Fix**: The program should output the specific error that the leap day is not valid.
    - **Expected Outcome**: Users would know that the invalid error is due to leap day.

8. **Enhance String Validation For Names**
   - **Feature Flaw**: Currently same names with different spacing between parts of names are accepted as different names.
   - **Proposed Solution**: The new volunteer and new event commands should automatically standardise all spaces in a volunteer's or an event's name.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Users should be prevented from accidentally adding duplicate volunteers or events with different number of spaces within names.

9. **Enhance Output Message Alignment**
   - **Feature Flaw**: Currently some success and error messages exceed the space available in one line and force the user to scroll the output box horizontally to read the full message.
   - **Proposed Solution**: The output message should wrap in the output text box.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Users should be able to read and understand error message with less trouble and confusion.

10. **Improve Error Message Specificity**
    - **Feature Flaw**: Currently errors messages are not specific.
    - **Proposed Solution**: Error message should indicate the specific reason the command (e.g. invalid index/assignment fails due to overlapping event assignment or fails due to the volunteer not being free on the day of the event).
    - **Expected Outcome**: Users should be able to read and instantly understand the reason their command failed so that they can rectify the error without needing to check the possible causes one by one.

   

These planned enhancements aim to address known issues and improve the overall usability, reliability, and user experience of **VolunSync**.
