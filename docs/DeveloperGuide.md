## **Acknowledgements**
MediBase3 is designed based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by [SE-EDU](https://se-education.org).

Generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Copilot) were used for creating test cases, writing detailed Javadocs and some code refactoring. 

The following Java libraries were also used in the development of MediBase3:
- [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) for the GUI
- [JUnit5](https://junit.org/junit5/) for testing
- [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) for processing JSON files

### Architecture

![](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png){:width="280"}

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete T1234567A`.

![](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png){:width="574"}

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

![](images/ComponentManagers.png){:width="300"}

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png){:width="740"}

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `OwnedAppointment` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

![](images/LogicClassDiagram.png){:width="550"}

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete S1234567A")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete S1234567A` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

{: .alert .alert-info}
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.


How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

![](images/ParserClasses.png){:width="600"}

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![](images/ModelClassDiagram.png){:width="740"}


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

{: .alert .alert-info}
:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has an `Allergy` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Allergy` object per unique Allergy, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Allergy` objects.

![](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png){:width="740"}

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

![](images/StorageClassDiagram.png){:width="740"}

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### `addAppt` - Add Appointment

This command enables the addition of an `Appointment` for a specified `Person` in the `Model`. Its implementation involves coordinated updates between the `Model` and UI.

As a refresher, this is the addAppt command as described in the User Guide:

> **Format**: 
> `addAppt APPOINTMENT_NAME i/NRIC @d/APPOINTMENT_DATE @t/APPOINTMENT_TIME`
> 
> **Example**:
> `addAppt Dental i/S1234567A @d/2024-10-27 @t/1100-1200` schedules a `Dental` appointment for the patient with `NRIC` `S1234567A` on `2024-10-27`, from `1100` to `1200`.
> 


#### Overview

When executed, this command parses user input and creates an internal representation of the appointment data. The sequence proceeds as follows:

1. **Parse Command and Target Person:**  
   The input command text is parsed to identify the type of command and the target `Person` for the appointment. If the `Person` is found in the model, the process continues with creating an appointment.

2. **Create and Add Appointment:**  
   A new `Appointment` is created with the provided details, and an updated `Person` object is prepared, associating this appointment with the target individual.

3. **Model Update:**  
   The model replaces the old `Person` with this modified version in the address book, which then updates the internal list of appointments to include the new entry.

4. **Automatic UI Refresh:**  
   The `AppointmentListPanel` UI component, which observes changes in the list of appointments, detects the addition and refreshes its display. The UI then reflects this change by showing a new `AppointmentCard` for the recently added appointment.

{: .alert .alert-primary}
> :bulb: **Tip:**
>
> Immutability in `Person` objects prevents data conflicts by ensuring the `AddressBook` only stores updated versions, eliminating orphaned data. Each update cycle refreshes the relevant list views, automatically redrawing the necessary UI elements in the correct order.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Sequence Diagram

When `addAppt` command is keyed in by the user, `AddApptCommandParser#parse()` generates the a new `AddApptCommand` with the arguments `AppointmentName`, `AppointmentTime`, `AppointmentDate`, and `Nric` retrieved from the user command string. This diagram shows a high-level sequence of what happens when a valid `AddApptCommand` is executed:

### Deleting an appointment from a patient

Deleting an existing appointment from a patient

1. Prerequisites: List all patients using the `list` command. Ensure the patient has an appointment for `2024-05-19` during `1100-1230` already added.

2. Test case: `delAppt i/S1234567A @t/1100-1230 @d/2024-05-19`

   Expected: The appointment at `2024-05-19` during `1100-1230` is removed from the patient with NRIC `S1234567A`. A success message is shown summarising which appointment has been removed from which patient. The appointment no longer shows up under the target patient in the patient list, as well as in the appointment list. 

3. Test case: `delAppt i/S1234567A @t/0000-1234 @d/2024-05-19`

   Expected: No appointment is deleted. An error message is shown, indicating that the specified appointment does not exist for the patient.

4. Other incorrect commands to try: `delAppt`, `delAppt i/S1234567A`, `delAppt i/S1234567A @t/1100-1230`, `delAppt i/S1234567A @d/2024-05-19`, , `delAppt @t/0000-1234 @d/2024-05-19`

   Expected: An error message is shown, indicating that the command format is incorrect.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

1\. **Enhance Name Validation**

   Currently, MediBase3 restricts patient names to alphanumerics and spaces only, preventing the inclusion of common symbols, hyphens, and accented characters that are often found in legal names (e.g., 'Nagaratnam s/o Suppiah', 'Anya Taylor-Joy', 'Sergio PÃ©rez'). Additionally, the app allows leading, trailing, and multiple consecutive spaces, which can result in inconsistent formatting.

   This enhancement will:
   - Loosen restrictions to allow all other special and accented characters, enabling the accurate entry of a wider range of legitimate names.
   - Automatically trim any leading or trailing spaces and reduce multiple consecutive spaces to a single space, ensuring consistent formatting and reducing errors from accidental spacing during data entry.

   These changes will improve the inclusivity and data consistency of MediBase3's patient records.

2\. **Improve `addAppt` command to allow users to add multiple appointments at once**

  Currently, users can only add one appointment at a time using the `addAppt` command. We plan to enhance the `addAppt` command to allow users to add multiple appointments at once.
  This will be useful as it allows doctors to save time by adding multiple appointments for a patient in one go, instead of typing the same command multiple times.

3\. **Improve Email Validation**

  MediBase3 does not currently check if the email ends with a top-level domain (TLD) such as `.com` or `.org`. We plan to enhance the validation for email addresses to also check if the domain provided contains an actual top-level domain apart from the other existing constraints.

4\. **Allow partial addition and deletion of medical conditions and allergies**

  Currently, when adding or deleting multiple medical conditions or allergies with the `addMedCon`, `addAllergy`, `delMedCon`, or `delAllergy` commands, the entire command is rejected if any of the specified conditions or allergies already exist (in the case of `addMedCon` and `addAllergy`) or do not exist (in the case of `delMedCon` and `delAllergy`) for the patient. 
  This means that none of the conditions or allergies are processed, even if some are valid. 
  In the future, we plan to enhance these features by partially accepting the commandâ€”only rejecting the invalid entries and successfully adding or deleting the valid ones.

5\. **Enhance `find`, `findNric`, `findMedCon`, `listPrio` and `list` commands to update the Appointment List panel as well**

  Currently, commands that modify the Patient List panel do not update the Appointment List panel to show only the appointments of the currently listed patients. 
  Adding this feature would allow doctors to view the appointments of the visible patients in chronological order, rather than grouped under each patient's details.

6\. **Allow for foreign patients to be added to Medibase3**

  Currently, MediBase3 uses the patient's NRIC or FIN number as their unique identifier. However, this prevents doctors from adding foreign patients, who do not have a NRIC or FIN number, into Medibase3.
  As such, we plan on improving MediBase3 to allow doctors to add foreign patients by using other forms of identification, such as their passport number.

7\. **Make certain fields optional**

  Currently, all fields are mandatory when adding a patient. However, there could be cases where the patient does not have an email address or phone number.
  It would be ideal to make certain fields optional as it allows for more flexibility when adding patient details. However, the NRIC field should remain mandatory since it is the unique identifier for each patient which ensures that duplicate patients cannot be added.

8\. **Include Command Overview in Help Pop-Up**

  Currently, the pop-up that appears after using the `help` command only provides a link to the detailed user guide. Users are also required to copy the URL given, open a new browser and navigate away from the application to view the commands available.
  We plan to include a Command Overview in the pop-up that will display a list of all available commands and their respective constraints. This will allow users to quickly view the commands available without having to navigate away from the application.

9\. **Improve NRIC validation**

  The current NRIC validation used in MediBase3 does not align with Singapore's checksum algorithm for NRICs. As such, MediBase3 does not check if the starting letter and starting 2 digits of the NRIC aligns with the given date of birth.
  This allows users to enter either incorrect date of births or NRICs that do not align with each other. We plan to enhance the NRIC validation to check for such discrepancies, specifically for patients born on or after 1 January 1968 where [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Registration_Identity_Card#Structure_of_the_NRIC_number/FIN) rule applies.
