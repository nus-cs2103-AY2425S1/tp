## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [<u>`Main`</u>](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [<u>`MainApp`</u>](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**<u>`UI`</u>**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**<u>`Logic`</u>**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**<u>`Model`</u>**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**<u>`Storage`</u>**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**<u>`Commons`</u>**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `del n/Alex`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Another *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add-wed w/John & Gina v/CHIJMES d/11/12/25`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram2.puml" />

The four main components (also shown in the diagram above, staticContext is not a main component),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [<u>`Ui.java`</u>](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [<u>`MainWindow`</u>](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [<u>`MainWindow.fxml`</u>](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [<u>`Logic.java`</u>](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("view-wed Alex & Mary")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/ViewWeddingSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `view-wed Alex & Mary` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `ViewWeddingCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `ViewWeddingCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `ViewWeddingCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create an `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [<u>`Model.java`</u>](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the wedding book data i.e., all `Wedding` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueWeddingList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Wedding` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Wedding>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

### Storage component

**API** : [<u>`Storage.java`</u>](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, wedding book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `WeddingBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy feature implementation details of KnottyPlanners.

### [Wedding](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/wedding/Wedding.java) - Class for Wedding Events

The `Wedding` class represents a wedding event in KnottyPlanners. It includes details such as the wedding name, venue,
 date and participants. The `Wedding` class supports the following functions:

* `Add Wedding`: Creates a new `Wedding` in KnottyPlanners.
* `Delete Wedding`: Deletes an existing `Wedding` from KnottyPlanners and the associated tags.
* `List Weddings`: Lists all `Weddings` in KnottyPlanners.
* `View Wedding`: Displays participants of a specific `Wedding`.

Refer to our [**User Guide**](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-w13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html) for more information on how to use these functions associated with the Wedding Class.

### [StaticContext](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/StaticContext.java) - Confirmation Prompting for Deletion and Clear Commands

`StaticContext` is a utility class used to manage the state of pending operations in KnottyPlanners. It helps in handling deletion and clear commands by maintaining boolean flags and references to the entities to be deleted or cleared. 

The `StaticContext` class supports the following functions:

| Function                     | Associated Command                           |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `setClearAddressBookPending` | `clear-ab` / `cab`                           |
| `setClearWeddingBookPending` | `clear-wb` / `cwb`                           |
| `setPersonToDelete`          | `del n/NAME`                                 |
| `setWeddingToDelete`         | `del-wed w/NAME & NAME` / `dw w/NAME & NAME` |

Here is an example usage scenario and how `StaticContext` is used in KnottyPlanners.

1. The user requests to delete a `Wedding`. `StaticContext.setWeddingToDelete(wedding)` is called to set the `Wedding` to be deleted.

2. The user confirms the deletion. The `DeleteYCommand` checks `StaticContext.getWeddingToDelete()` and proceeds with the deletion.

3. The user requests to clear the wedding book. `StaticContext.setClearWeddingBookPending(true)` is called to set the clear operation as pending.

4. The user confirms the clear operation. The `DeleteYCommand` checks `StaticContext.isClearWeddingBookPending()` and proceeds with clearing the wedding book.

#### Design Considerations:

**Strict Command Guidelines:**

* Commands are designed to be strictly followed in their execution.
  * For example, any command that requires a confirmation prompt **must** be followed by a `y` or `n` to proceed or cancel the operation respectively.
  * This ensures that the user is aware of the operation being performed and prevents accidental deletions or clear operations.
  * Pros: Prevents accidental deletions or clear operations.
  * Cons: Executing other commands before `y` or `n` that modify the intended deletion or clear operation may lead to unexpected results. (We have implemented checks to prevent this)

**`tag-del` does not require confirmation:**

* The `tag-del` command does not require a confirmation prompt.
  * This is because the operation is reversible and does not have a significant impact on the data.
  * It is akin to adding a label to a contact, which can be removed without any significant consequences.
  * Pros: Saves time by not requiring a confirmation prompt for a reversible operation.
  * Cons: Users may not be satisfied that deletion operations are not consistent throughout with a confirmation prompt.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**1. Prefix Enhancements**

**Currently:** The view wedding command in KnottyPlanners does not require a need for a prefix to represent the wedding. Thus, when associating a wedding to a `Person`, it is done by _tagging_ them to it, making the prefix 't/'. 

**Plan:** To make the association of `Wedding` and `Person` more intuitive, we will change the prefix from 't/' to 'w/', representing the `Wedding` that a `Person` is associated with.

**2. Forced Deletion and Clearing**

**Currently:** To prevent accidental deletions and clearing of data in KnottyPlanners, a user confirmation is currently required to ensure that the action is intentional.

**Plan:** To include a force deletion or clearing command that enables the user to remove the data without KnottyPlanners requiring a confirmation from them, to increase efficiency.

**3. Improved Filtering**

**Currently:** The filter command in KnottyPlanners supports filtering by the name or job fields only.

**Plan:** To allow users to filter with other fields such as phone number, address and email.

**4. Allow Copying of Information**

**Currently:** KnottyPlanners is optimised for keyboard usage, and direct copying of information from the GUI is not supported.

**Plan:** To allow the users of KnottyPlanners to copy information directly from the contact or wedding cards, in order to facilitate mouse usage. We will also include a feature to export the information to a text file or csv file for easy sharing.

**5. Support for Long Inputs**

**Currently:** KnottyPlanners only support inputs up till a reasonable amount of characters. As such, extreme inputs that exceed our limit can potentially hinder the viewing of information when the user does not resize the window.

**Plan:** To handle extreme inputs of all fields with a long character count, ensuring that the information can still remain visible.

**6. Index Referencing**

**Currently:** KnottyPlanners requires users to select the `Person` from their names in order to reduce ambiguity. However, this can result in inefficiency when handling extremely long names.

**Plan:** To allow users to reference the contact or wedding based on their index in the list, in addition to our current implementation. This ensures that the efficiency of KnottyPlanners is maintained.

**7. Further CLI Support**

**Currently:** Opening the help window creates an external popup that requires the user to close with a mouse or trackpad.

**Plan:** Enhance CLI optimisation by allowing the user to close the popup without using a mouse or trackpad.

**8. Contacts and Weddings Visibility**

**Currently:** The address and wedding lists are in two separate views to help the wedding planner to be more focused and reduce cluttering of information. This can lead to an additional need to toggle between the wedding book and address book to recall the names of the wedding.

**Plan:** To have an integrated view that contains both the persons and weddings side by side, allowing the association of persons to weddings to be done with less memory work.

**9. Comprehensive Language Support**

**Currently:** KnottyPlanners supports names in English language without special characters such as "^" or non-English names.

**Plan:** To have a more comprehensive language allowance for names with special characters and non-English names, making KnottyPlanners more inclusive. To maintain checks for incorrect entry of data, KnottyPlanners will then prompt the user if special characters have been used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Wedding planners who organise multiple weddings concurrently
* Possesses a need to manage a significant number of contacts with various roles
* Requires efficient categorisation of all stakeholders in a wedding
* Can type fast and prefers typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Manage contacts of all stakeholders of multiple weddings with ease and convenience.
