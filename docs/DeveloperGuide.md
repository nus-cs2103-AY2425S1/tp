</div>

### Architecture

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given below explains the high-level design of TalentSG and how the components work
together.

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** consists of two classes: [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch: it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

This component is responsible for displaying the graphical elements of TalentSG's GUI to the user.

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of the following parts:

- `Help Window`
- `OverviewPanel`
  - `OverviewListCard`
- `ReportBugWindow`
- `ResultDisplay`
- `PersonListPanel`
  - `PersonCard`
- `CommandBox`

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

This component is responsible for processing and executing user commands

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

This component is responsible for storing and managing TalentSG’s data

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

</div>


### Storage component

This component is responsible for saving and retrieving TalentSG's data

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

</div>

#### `ViewCommand` Implementation Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram below illustrates the above process of deleting a person from TalentSG.

<img src="images/ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

#### **Design Considerations**

## Aspect: Command-Based Updates vs. Direct Modifications in `executeCommand`

### Alternative 1 (Current choice): Direct Update in `executeCommand`
Modify UI components such as `personListPanel` and `overviewPanel` directly within `executeCommand`, without relying
solely on `CommandResult` to signal UI updates.

- **Pros**: Provides immediate control over UI elements based on the command type (e.g., selecting a person in 
`personListPanel` or showing the summary in `overviewPanel`). This approach eliminates the need to interpret `CommandResult` externally, centralizing UI updates in `executeCommand`.
- **Cons**: Tightly couples the `executeCommand` method with the internal details of UI components. This can make the 
`MainWindow` class harder to maintain or extend, especially if more components or command types are added.

### Alternative 2: Use `CommandResult` with External Processing
Use `CommandResult` as an intermediate data structure, allowing other methods or classes to handle the UI updates based on `CommandResult`.

- **Pros**: Maintains separation of concerns by keeping `executeCommand` focused on obtaining a result, 
while another part of the codebase interprets and applies `CommandResult`. This separation is beneficial for 
maintainability, extensibility, and testing, especially when handling multiple types of commands.
- **Cons**: Additional handlers may need to be implemented for different `CommandResult` types, potentially leading to extra code complexity.

### Summary Feature

#### **Command Feature**

`summary`

#### **Command Feature Purpose**

The `summary` command provides a breakdown of the application statuses of all the people in the `AddressBook`.

#### Key Components
- **`SummaryCommand`**: Executes the summarization operation to display the counts for each application status in the `AddressBook`.
- **`AddressBookParser`**: Parses user input to create a `SummaryCommand` object.
- **`LogicManager`**: Invokes the `SummaryCommand` to execute the summary operation.
- **`ModelManager`**: Implements the `Model` interface and contains the internal list of persons.
- **`CommandResult`**: Encapsulates the result of the command execution, including any feedback to the user.

### **Sequence of action**

To help you understand how the `summary` command works, here is a list of steps illustrating what occurs when [`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked](#logic-component):

We will be using the user input `summary` as an example:

1. The user executes the command `summary`, intending to view a breakdown of all application statuses for candidates in the `AddressBook`
2. The `AddressBookParser` interprets the input and creates a `SummaryCommand` object.
3. The `LogicManager` invokes the execute method of `SummaryCommand`.
4. The execute method of `SummaryCommand` initializes a map of all possible statuses with counts set to 0.
5. `SummaryCommand` collects the list of all candidates in the address book via `Model` and computes the count for each application status using a grouping and counting operation.
6. The execute method of `SummaryCommand` formats these counts into a summary message, displaying each status count and the total number of applicants.
7. The execute method of `SummaryCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object, encapsulating the summary message for display to the user.
8. The UI then reflects this summarized breakdown of application statuses.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note**:

- At step 2, if an invalid input is detected after `summary` (e.g. `summary abc`), an error will be shown and the sequence of action is terminated.
</div>

#### `SummaryCommand` Implementation Sequence Diagram
The sequence diagram below illustrates the above process of executing the `summary` command in TalentSG, which lists all persons in the address book.

#### **Design Considerations**

## Aspect: Separation of Concerns in `SummaryCommand`

### Alternative 1: Refactor Counting and Formatting into Separate Helper Methods
Refactor the counting and formatting logic into separate helper methods or utility classes, separating the data processing (counting) from the presentation (formatting).

- **Pros**:
    - Promotes separation of concerns by clearly dividing the responsibility for counting and formatting, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
    - Easier to test each part of the functionality independently, as the counting logic and formatting can be tested in isolation.
    - More extensible: Additional logic (e.g., more complex formatting) can be added without affecting the core data processing.

- **Cons**:
    - Requires refactoring the existing logic into multiple parts, increasing the number of methods or classes.
    - Adds complexity in managing additional methods or classes.

### Alternative 2: Handling Counting and Formatting Together in `SummaryCommand`
The `SummaryCommand` currently handles both counting the application statuses and formatting the summary message in the `execute` method.

- **Pros**:
    - Simplicity: All logic related to the summary is in one place, making it straightforward to understand in the context of a single command.
    - Fewer classes to manage, keeping the flow of logic centralized.

- **Cons**:
    - Mixing counting logic and presentation logic (formatting the summary) within the same method violates the principle of separation of concerns.
    - Makes it harder to extend or test each part of the logic independently.
    - Reduces maintainability as the class grows, as any changes to either the counting or formatting logic will require modifications in the same place.
---

### Help Feature

#### **Command Feature**

`help`

#### **Command Feature Purpose**

The `help` command provides a breakdown of the application statuses of all the people in the `AddressBook`.

#### Key Components
- **`HelpCommand`**: Executes the operation to display the help instructions.
- **`AddressBookParser`**: Parses user input to create a `HelpCommand` object.
- **`CommandResult`**: Opens the help window and encapsulates the result of the command execution

### **Sequence of action**

To help you understand how the `help` command works, here is a list of steps illustrating what occurs when [`LogicManager#execute()` is invoked](#logic-component):

We will be using the user input `help` as an example:

1. The user executes the command `help`, intending to view usage instructions for the `AddressBook`
2. The `AddressBookParser` interprets the input and creates a `HelpCommand` object.
3. The execute method of `HelpCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object, triggering the opening of the help window in the UI
4. The UI then reflects this summarized breakdown of application statuses.

The CommandResult object is then passed to the UI, which opens a panel displaying the help content.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note**:

- At step 2, if an invalid input is detected after `help` (e.g. `help a123`), an error will be shown and the sequence of action is terminated.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**


### 1. Overview Panel Not Cleared

**Issue**: When using the `clear` command, all candidates are removed from the **Applicants List**, but if a candidate was previously selected, their details remain displayed in the **Overview Panel**.

**Expected Behavior**: Ideally, the **Overview Panel** should also be cleared when the list is empty, as no candidates are available for viewing.

**Reason**: This behaviour occurs due to the absence of an observer pattern or listener attached to the **Overview Panel** to automatically update it upon list changes. As a result, the **Overview Panel** does not reset when the **Applicants List** is emptied.

**Potential Solution**:
- Implement an observer pattern where the **Overview Panel** observes changes in the **Applicants List**. If the **Applicants List** is empty (such as after a `clear` command), the **Overview Panel** should reset to an empty state or display a default message.

  > **Suggested Implementation**: Use an observer that listens for changes in the candidate list model and updates the **Overview Panel** accordingly. This would ensure that both `clear` and `delete` commands properly update the **Overview Panel**.

**Current Workaround**: Users can manually select a new candidate (if available) or restart the app to refresh the **Overview Panel**.

---

### 2. Update Overview After Executing Command

**Issue**: When using the `add`, `edit` and `delete` commands, the **Overview Panel** will not display the correct information immediately.

**Expected Behavior**: Ideally, the **Overview Panel** should display the correct information immediately after executing the commands mentioned.

**Reason**: This behaviour occurs due to the absence of an observer pattern or listener attached to the **Overview Panel** to automatically update it upon list changes.

**Potential Solution**:
- Implement an observer pattern where the **Overview Panel** observes changes in the **Applicants List**. If the **Applicants List** is empty (such as after a `clear` command), the **Overview Panel** should reset to an empty state or display a default message.

  > **Suggested Implementation**: Use an observer that listens for changes in the candidate list model and updates the **Overview Panel** accordingly. This would ensure that the `add`, `edit` and `delete` commands properly update the **Overview Panel**.

**Current Workaround**:
1. Users can manually click on the summary button.
2. Type `summary` under the CLI terminal.
3. Restart the app.

---

### 3. No panel is displayed when commands that results in an empty Applicants List are used

**Issue**: When using commands such as `delete`, `filter`, or any other command that results in an empty **Applicants List**, no panel is displayed.

**Expected Behavior**: Ideally, the **Applicants Panel** should display a placeholder message when there are no applicants in the list after executing commands like `delete` or `filter`.

**Reason**: This behavior is due to the default nature of `ListView`, which hides the display area when the list is empty. Additionally, adding a blank item to `ListView` is restricted by the regex validation requirements.

**Potential Solution**:
- Set a placeholder message in the `ListView` to display when the list is empty. This would give users feedback indicating that no items are currently available in the **Applicants List**.

  > **Suggested Implementation**: Configure the `ListView`’s `setPlaceholder` method to show a message, such as "No applicants to display," whenever the **Applicants List** is empty.

---

### 4. Dynamic Summary Update

**Issue**: The summary statistics in the **UI** do not update automatically when data is modified through `add`, `edit`, `delete`, or `clear` commands. Users must manually run the `summary` command to refresh the statistics.

**Expected Behavior**: The **Summary Panel** should automatically display updated statistics in real-time as soon as any changes are made to the applicant data.

**Reason**: The lack of dynamic updating is due to the current structure, which does not have an automatic trigger for the **Summary Panel** when data is modified.

**Potential Solution**:
- Implement dynamic rendering in the **Summary Panel** that listens for changes in the applicant data model, updating the statistics in real-time.

**Current Workaround**: Users can manually trigger the `summary` command to update the statistics.

---

### 5. Enhanced Filtering Options

**Issue**: Currently, the app only allows filtering by applicant status, limiting its usefulness for HR professionals who may want to filter based on other criteria like job roles or skills.

**Expected Behavior**: The filtering functionality should support multiple criteria such as "Desired Role" and "Skills" to allow users to narrow down applicants more effectively.

**Reason**: Expanding filtering criteria will give users more flexibility to view subsets of candidates that match specific requirements.

**Potential Solution**:
- Extend the filter command to support additional parameters like `Desired Role` and `Skills`, allowing more refined filtering capabilities.

---

### 6. Real-Time Overview Update After Editing Details

**Issue**: The **Overview Panel** does not update automatically when applicant details are modified through `add`, `edit`, `delete`, or `clear` commands. Users must manually run the `view` command to refresh the displayed information.

**Expected Behavior**: The **Overview Panel** should reflect updated information immediately after any modification to an applicant's details.

**Potential Solution**:
- Implement an observer pattern for the **Overview Panel** to automatically display updated details whenever an applicant’s information is edited.

**Current Workaround**: Users can manually re-select the applicant or restart the application to refresh the details.

---

### 7. Bulk Actions for Candidate Management

**Issue**: Currently, users must perform actions (such as `delete` or `update status`) on candidates individually, which can be time-consuming for larger candidate pools.

**Expected Behavior**: Users should be able to select multiple candidates and perform bulk actions such as updating status, assigning tags, or deleting.

**Potential Solution**:
- Introduce a bulk action feature that enables users to select multiple candidates and apply actions in one step.

**Current Workaround**: Users need to perform actions individually on each candidate.

---

### 8. Improved Sorting Options in Applicants List

**Issue**: Sorting of applicants is currently limited to a single criterion (e.g., alphabetical order), which restricts HR professionals from organizing candidates by specific factors.

**Expected Behavior**: The **Applicants List** should support sorting by additional fields such as "Experience," "Application Date," and "Desired Role."

**Potential Solution**:
- Add sorting functionality with multiple parameters to the **Applicants List**, enabling users to sort based on their specific needs.

**Current Workaround**: Users may need to manually search or scroll through the list to find candidates matching specific criteria.

---

### 9. UI Layout Disorganization When Moving Between Monitors

**Issue**: When moving the application window from one monitor to another, the UI layout becomes disorganized, resulting in significant blank spaces.

**Expected Behavior**: The UI layout should remain consistent across monitors, preserving the intended spacing and component alignment.

**Reason**: This issue occurs due to JavaFX's handling of different display settings, such as resolution and scaling, on multiple monitors. JavaFX may not always adapt smoothly to changes in display properties, leading to UI scaling inconsistencies when moving between monitors.

**Potential Solution**:
1. **Dynamic Layout Recalibration**: Implement a recalibration feature that triggers when a monitor or resolution change is detected. This could be achieved using JavaFX listeners to detect display changes, prompting a layout refresh to adjust to the new display properties.

2. **Adaptive Layout Constraints**: Modify the application to use anchor or percent-based layout constraints instead of absolute positioning, as these are more adaptable to different monitor configurations and can prevent layout inconsistencies.

**Current Workaround**: Users can manually adjust the application window size after moving it to a new monitor to minimize the layout issues.

## **Appendix: Effort**

Working on TalentSG was both a challenging and rewarding experience for our entire team. As a few members in team had
prior experience working in properly-structured teams, we were able to effectively divide tasks and collaborate efficiently.
However, during the initial stages of our team project, we found it difficult to understand the structure of
AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) and navigate through the codebase. In turn, we spent a lot of time understanding the existing
application and helping each other when we needed it.

We faced a few challenges while working on TalentSG:

1. Becoming familiar with the existing AB3 codebase
2. How to integrate the view command such that it worked with both the Logic and UI components
3. Maintaining the abstraction principles when implementing new classes and methods
4. Quality code testing of code

Our group reused a lot of what AB3 had in place - we reused AB3's parsing, command handling, and storage structure for
the newly implemented commands (summary, view, filter) as we found it to be modular and organized.

Overall, our team put in a significant amount of effort to understand the existing codebase and implement the new features
to successfully transform AB3 into TalentSG. Our hard work paid off, and we are proud that we ended up with a solid,
user-friendly platform that meets our users needs.
