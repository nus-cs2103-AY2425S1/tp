### Reference to Other Work
The **Implementation** section in this developer's guide was created with reference to the structure and content of the 
[AY2425S1-CS2103T-T09-2 team’s Developer Guide](https://ay2425s1-cs2103t-t09-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#add-person-feature). 
Their detailed explanation of the **Add Person Feature** served as a guide for elaborating the feature implementations in this document.

## **Design**

**Note:** In this section, we reference specific class names such as `Person`, `AddressBook`, and other terminology
that may differ from the terms used in other parts of this Developer Guide. The terms used here are intended
specifically for Design discussions and might not directly correspond to the broader terms used elsewhere in the documentation.
For clarification:
* `Person` is generally referred to as an Udder in most other sections of this guide.
* `AddressBook` refers to FindingbrUdders in other contexts within this guide.

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `DetailPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed, such as to delete a person (Udder).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)



### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-F08-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

**Note:** In this section, we reference specific class names such as `Person`, `AddressBook`, and other terminology
that may differ from the terms used in other parts of this Developer Guide. The terms used here are intended 
specifically for code implementation discussions and might not directly correspond to the broader terms used elsewhere in the documentation.
For clarification:
* `Person` is generally referred to as an Udder in most other sections of this guide.
* `AddressBook` refers to FindingbrUdders in other contexts within this guide. 

Please note that Udder and `Person` as well as FindingbrUdders and `AddressBook` <u>will be used interchangably</u> in this section to maintain consistency with the 
implementation-specific discussions. 

Additionally, for clarity regarding the UI components discussed in this section,
a screenshot of the user interface - partially labeled with component names - is included below:

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

**Team size:** 5

1. **Command Consistency Improvements:**
    * Standardize the behavior of the `delete` command to reset the Person List Panel post-execution, aligning with the current behavior of `add` and `edit` commands. This change will improve user experience by providing consistent feedback and list visibility.
2. **Email Validation Enhancement:**
    * Refine the email validity checks to include verification of the domain, ensuring that the email not only contains an '@' symbol followed by any alphanumeric characters, but also follows a valid format with a recognized domain. This enhancement aims to reduce incorrect/invalid email entries and improve data integrity.
3. **Email Search Logic Enhancement:**
    * Revamp the find functionality for the email field to accommodate searches without the typical formatting of a valid email address, thus broadening the search capabilities.
4. **Duplicate Handling Improvements:**
    * Revamp the duplicate detection logic to identify duplicates based on phone numbers and email addresses, ignoring whitespace variations. 
    * Names will no longer be considered for duplicate checks due to the possibility of multiple individuals sharing the same name, thus mimicking real-world scenarios more accurately.
5. **Cross-Platform UI Consistency:**
    * Implement font packaging within the software to ensure UI consistency across different operating systems, particularly addressing layout issues on MacOS caused by missing font styles.
6. **Detail Panel Behavior Correction:**
    * Adjust the behavior of the Detail Panel to clear its contents when the last Udder in the Person List Panel is deleted, ensuring that no outdated information remains visible, thereby preventing user confusion.
7. **UI Layout Improvements:**
    * Allow the meeting list to be displayed in the Detail Panel instead of the Result Display Panel for enhanced readability.
    * Provide options for users to choose which panel (Detail or Person List Panel) to expand, instead of defaulting to expanding only the Person List Panel.
    * Increase the size of the Result Display Panel for improved user interaction and readability.
8. **Enhanced Tag Management:**
    * Improve the management and display of role tags in the Person List Panel to ensure they are not truncated or hidden, regardless of the length of the Udder's name. This will enhance visibility and accessibility of important categorizations within the user interface.
9. **Meeting Deletion Streamlining:**
    * Streamline the meeting deletion process (`deletem`) by allowing the Detail Panel to display the meetings list, facilitating easier and faster batch deletions without needing to repeatedly execute the meetings command to refresh the index.
10. **Meeting Date Validation:**
    * Change the validation logic for meeting dates to prevent the system from auto-correcting invalid dates to the nearest valid ones, which is the cause for our current app version's inconsistent behavior in its meeting date validation. 
    * After the enhancement, if an entered date is invalid, the system will prompt an error, requiring the user to correct the input.
