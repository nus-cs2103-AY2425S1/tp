## **Design**



### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of EduLog.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the Logic Component"/>
<box type="important" seamless> XYZCommand can also be structured as an abstract class to serve as a base for a set of related child commands that would be implemented individually as concrete classes.
</box>
The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.
**This example can be used as a guide for all EduLog commands**.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
<box type="info" seamless>

<b>Note:</b> The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `EdulogParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `EdulogParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `EdulogParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="750" />

<box type="important" seamless> The unnamed box encosing some of the classess is drawn only to provide visual clarity and does not imply the existence of a package. </box>


The `Model` component,

* stores the edulog data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>
e
<b>Note:</b> An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a <code>Tag</code> list in the <code>EduLog</code>, which <code>Student</code> references. This allows <code>EduLog</code> to only require one <code>Tag</code> object per unique tag, instead of each <code>Student</code> needing their own <code>Tag</code> objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-W09-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both edulog data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `EdulogStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.edulog.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedEdulog`. It extends `Edulog` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `eduLogStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedEdulog#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current edulog state in its history.
* `VersionedEdulog#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous edulog state from its history.
* `VersionedEdulog#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone edulog state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitEdulog()`, `Model#undoEdulog()` and `Model#redoEdulog()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedEdulog` will be initialized with the initial edulog state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single edulog state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th student in the edulog. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitEdulog()`, causing the modified state of the edulog after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `eduLogStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted edulog state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new student. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitEdulog()`, causing another modified edulog state to be saved into the `eduLogStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

<b>Note:</b> If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitEduLog()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `eduLogStateList`.
</box>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
<b>Note:</b> If a command fails its execution, it will not call <code>Model#commitEdulog()</code>, so the edulog state will not be saved into the <code>eduLogStateList</code>.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoEdulog()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous edulog state, and restores the edulog to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />
<box type="info" seamless>

<b>Note:</b> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial EduLog state, then there are no previous EduLog states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoEduLog()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

<b>Note:</b> The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoEduLog()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

<b>Note:</b> If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `eduLogStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone EduLog states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoEduLog()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitEduLog()`, `Model#undoEduLog()` or `Model#redoEduLog()`. Thus, the `eduLogStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitEdulog()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `eduLogStateList`, all edulog states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire edulog.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Edulog should work on any mainstream OS, as long as the system has `java 17 jdk` installed.
2. The app should work on any mainstream computer architecture.
3. The app should also work on 32-bit and 64-bit architecture.
4.  Any command inputted by the user must be resolved within 1 second.
5. The app should be able to store 1000 student entries without any noticeable lag.
6. The app should not need any additional installation steps to run. The user only needs to run `java -jar Edulog.jar` to run the app.
7. The app should work without internet connection.
8. The app should work in devices with at least 4 GB of RAM and 64G of storage.
9. The app should take up at most 100MB of space, but this does not include user data.
10. The user needs only a keyboard to utilise all functionalities of the app.
11. Any external libraries used must be open sourced.
12. The app must not use a DBMS to store user data.
13. The GUI must work well (i.e everything displayed appropriately) for screen resolutions of 1920X1080 and higher.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<box type="info" seamless>
<b>Note:</b> These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more <b>exploratory</b> testing.

</box>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

1. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   1. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.



### Deleting a student

1. Deleting a student while all students are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all students using the `list` command. Multiple students in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No student is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.



### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Prequisites: Invalid data. For example, create edit a existing student json file with a invalid phone number by adding `@`
   2. Launch the jar file. Expected behaviour is that EduLog is now completely empty, with no students and lessons.

## **Appendix: Planned enhancements**

Team size: 5

1. **No warning for data-removing commands**: Destructive commands like `delete`, `deletec`, and `clear` will remove
data - this may be undesirable for users due to typos in commands that my cause them to remove data unexpectedly.
The team plans to add the `undo` command for future iterations.

2. **Lesson clarity: specify end day**: Lessons currently have their start day, start time, and end time displayed.
For lessons that span midnight, e.g. Monday 2200-0100, it could be helpful for the user if the day at the
end of the lesson can be described as well: Monday 2200-Tuesday 0100. The team will provide this Quality of Life
feature in future iterations.

3. **Delete lessons by index**: Lessons currently must be deleted by their descriptions only. This is done with the
expectation that lessons are created much less frequently than students and are important not to delete without backup.
However, the team sees value in providing a Quality of Life change to delete these lessons by index once the deletion
commands have been rail-guarded by the `undo` command in future iterations.

4. **Markall/unmarkall based on current view**: Presently, marking / unmarking of every student's paid status works
regardless of the current filtered student list. For future iterations, we shall work on developing a variant of
the `markall` / `unmarkall` commands only marks / unmarks all students in the current view.

5. **Keep student filter when editing**: Presently, after the student list has been filtered, the editing of a 
student's details in that list will cause the filter to reset. To prevent annoyance for users who may wish to
continue work on the filtered student list without resets, our team will be pursuing this quality of life change
in future iterations.
