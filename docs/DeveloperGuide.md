## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_student 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete_student 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_student 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a student).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**


### Introduction
This section of the developer Guide covers how the features are implemented and executed.

### Features Overview
Listed below are the implemented features, and a brief description of what they do.
* **Adding a new Assignment**: Adds a new Assignment for a particular student
* **Grading an existing Assignment**: Grades an existing assignment belonging to an existing student, while simultaneously marking the assignment as "submitted".
* **Deleting an existing Assignment**: Deletes an existing assignment belonging to an existing student
* **Marking an existing Assignment**: Marks an existing assignment belonging to an existing student as "Submitted", without assigning a grade.
* **Unmarking an existing Assignment**: Unmarks an existing assignment belonging to an existing student, resetting its submission status to "not submitted", and resetting grade (if any).
* **Editing an existing Assignment**: Edits details of an existing assignment belonging to an existing student.
* **Viewing a student's details**: Displays students details along with the assignments associated with the student
* **Adding a remark to a student**: Adds a remark to an existing student

### Adding a new Assignment
This `add_assignment` command is a feature that  allows the user to create a new assignment, based on the student's index. The assignment must have an alphanumeric `Name`, and a valid `Max Score`.

#### Design Considerations:
Previously, AB3 had a single command word for the `add` commands. As TAchy is a brownfield project, additional objects are now allowed to be instantiated via the `add` command.
In particular, TAchy has 2 features that "add" items to the app. Firstly, there is an `add_student` feature, and also an `add_assignment` feature.

**Aspect: How to distinguish between the different 'add' commands:**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Distinguish command word, and thus allow only 1 type of object to be created at a time.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, and less prone to Users making errors in command format
  * Cons: User will only be able to add either students or assignments, one at a time

* Alternative 2: Allow multiple objects to be created concurrently.
  * Pros: Allows adept users to create new objects in the app more quickly
  * Cons: Difficult to implement, and users are prone to making more mistakes in supplying the valid parameters used.


#### Implementation
* LogicManager executes the command "add_assignment".
* LogicManager parses the command via AddressBookParser.
* AddressBookParser creates and delegates parsing to AddAssignmentCommandParser.
* AddAssignmentCommandParser creates an AddAssignmentCommand object.
* AddAssignmentCommand is returned to AddAssignmentCommandParser and back to AddressBookParser.
* LogicManager then executes AddAssignmentCommand, which interacts with the Model.
* AddAssignmentCommand creates a CommandResult object.
* CommandResult is returned to AddAssignmentCommand, which returns the result to LogicManager.
* The sequence concludes with the return to the caller from LogicManager.
* This describes the flow of command execution, parsing, and interaction with the model.

### Grading an Existing Assignment

#### Design Considerations
In TAchy, grading assignments involves updating an existing assignment associated with a specific student. To ensure accuracy and reduce potential user error, the grading command is designed to use index-based references for both students and assignments.

**Aspect: How to identify the target assignment and student for grading:**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Use indexes for both student and assignment identification.
    * Pros: Ensures precise identification of students and assignments, reducing the risk of errors caused by duplicate or similar names.
    * Cons: Users must know the exact index values, which may require additional steps to locate.

* Alternative 2: Allow grading by student and assignment names.
    * Pros: Could be more intuitive for users familiar with the student and assignment names.
    * Cons: Prone to errors due to possible duplicates or misspellings, making it less reliable for precise grading actions.

#### Implementation

1. **GradeAssignmentCommandParser**
    - This parser is responsible for interpreting the command input for grading an assignment. It ensures that the required prefixes (`PREFIX_STUDENT_INDEX`, `PREFIX_ASSIGNMENT_INDEX`, and `PREFIX_ASSIGNMENT_SCORE`) are present in the command.
    - After tokenizing and verifying the presence of necessary prefixes, it extracts the values for `studentIndex`, `assignmentIndex`, and `score` using helper methods in `ParserUtil`. If any of these values cannot be parsed correctly, an exception is thrown.
    - Finally, it returns a new `GradeAssignmentCommand`, initialized with these parsed values.

2. **GradeAssignmentCommand**
    - **Execution Steps**:
        - The command retrieves the current list of students and verifies the validity of `studentIndex`. If the index is out of bounds, an error is thrown.
        - Using `assignmentIndex`, it retrieves the assignment from the selected studentâ€™s assignment list. If the index is invalid, an error is thrown.
        - It then checks if the `score` is within acceptable parameters, ensuring it does not exceed the assignmentâ€™s maximum score and is non-negative.
        - The command updates the assignment with the provided `score`, sets flags to indicate the assignment has been graded, and marks it as submitted.
        - A `CommandResult` object is created with a success message. If the assignment was previously graded, a message noting that the grade has been overwritten is shown.

    - **Error Handling**:
        - If the `studentIndex` is invalid, a `CommandException` is thrown with `MESSAGE_INVALID_STUDENT_DISPLAYED_INDEX`.
        - If the `assignmentIndex` is invalid, a `CommandException` is thrown with `MESSAGE_INVALID_ASSIGNMENT_INDEX`.
        - If the `score` exceeds the maximum allowed for the assignment, a `CommandException` is thrown with `MESSAGE_SCORE_EXCEEDS_MAX_SCORE`.
        - If the `score` is negative, a `CommandException` is thrown with `MESSAGE_NEGATIVE_SCORE`.

This process ensures that grading an assignment is a straightforward, index-based operation that minimizes user error and provides clear feedback for invalid inputs.

### Deleting an Existing Assignment

#### Design Considerations
To delete assignments effectively, the design uses an index-based approach (similar to `GradeAssignmentCommand`) to identify both the student and the specific assignment to be deleted. This approach avoids issues with name duplication and user errors that may arise from typos or ambiguous assignment names.

#### Implementation

1. **DeleteAssignmentCommandParser**
    - This parser is responsible for interpreting the command input for deleting an assignment. It ensures that the necessary prefixes (`PREFIX_STUDENT_INDEX` and `PREFIX_ASSIGNMENT_INDEX`) are present in the command.
    - After tokenizing and validating the input, it extracts values for `studentIndex` and `assignmentIndex` using helper methods from `ParserUtil`. If parsing fails, an exception is thrown.
    - It then returns a new `DeleteAssignmentCommand`, initialized with these parsed values.

2. **DeleteAssignmentCommand**
    - **Execution Steps**:
        - Retrieves the current list of students and verifies the `studentIndex` to ensure it is within bounds. If the index is invalid, an exception is thrown.
        - Using `assignmentIndex`, retrieves the assignment from the specified student's assignment list. If the index is out of bounds, an exception is thrown.
        - Removes the specified assignment from the list, updates the modelâ€™s filtered student list, and returns a `CommandResult` object confirming the deletion.

    - **Error Handling**:
        - If `studentIndex` is invalid, a `CommandException` is thrown with `MESSAGE_INVALID_STUDENT_DISPLAYED_INDEX`.
        - If `assignmentIndex` is invalid, a `CommandException` is thrown with `MESSAGE_INVALID_ASSIGNMENT_INDEX`.

This approach provides a straightforward way to delete assignments, minimizing user error through precise index-based identification.


### Marking an Assignment as Submitted

#### Design Considerations
For marking assignments as submitted, the team discussed whether a "default" grade should be assigned to newly submitted assignments. Ultimately, the decision was made to avoid assigning any default grade. Instead, the user experience (UX) was designed to clearly indicate that an assignment is marked as submitted but has not yet been graded. This approach ensures transparency and encourages users to assign a meaningful grade once the assignment is evaluated.

**Aspect: Handling grades for newly submitted assignments:**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Do not assign a default grade upon submission.
    * Pros: Avoids arbitrary grading, encourages meaningful grading by users, and clearly indicates that the assignment has not been evaluated.
    * Cons: Requires users to remember to grade the assignment later.

* Alternative 2: Automatically assign a default grade (e.g., 0) upon submission.
    * Pros: Ensures a consistent "graded" status for all submitted assignments.
    * Cons: Could mislead users into thinking the assignment has been graded, even if no evaluation has occurred.

#### Implementation

1. **MarkAssignmentCommandParser**
    - This parser is responsible for interpreting the command input for marking an assignment as submitted. It verifies the presence of necessary prefixes (`PREFIX_STUDENT_INDEX` and `PREFIX_ASSIGNMENT_INDEX`).
    - After tokenizing and validating the input, it retrieves the values for `studentIndex` and `assignmentIndex` using helper methods in `ParserUtil`. If parsing fails, a `ParseException` is thrown.
    - Returns a new `MarkAssignmentCommand` initialized with the parsed values.

2. **MarkAssignmentCommand**
    - **Execution Steps**:
        - Retrieves the list of students and validates `studentIndex` to confirm it is within bounds. If invalid, an exception is thrown.
        - Using `assignmentIndex`, it retrieves the assignment from the targeted studentâ€™s assignment list and confirms the index is valid.
        - Checks if the assignment is already marked as submitted; if so, an exception is thrown.
        - Updates the assignmentâ€™s status to submitted and refreshes the filtered student list in the model.
        - Returns a `CommandResult` object with a message confirming the assignment was successfully marked as submitted.

    - **Error Handling**:
        - Throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_INVALID_STUDENT_DISPLAYED_INDEX` if `studentIndex` is invalid.
        - Throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_INVALID_ASSIGNMENT_INDEX` if `assignmentIndex` is invalid.
        - Throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_ALREADY_MARKED` if the assignment is already marked as submitted.

### Unmarking an Assignment as 'Not Submitted'

#### Design Considerations
When an assignment is unmarked, the team considered whether the assignment's score should be retained or reset. Ultimately, it was determined that retaining the score would be misleading, as unmarking indicates that the assignment is "not submitted" and any previous grading was likely erroneous. Therefore, the score is reset to zero, and the assignment is marked as "not graded."

**Aspect: Handling scores for unmarked assignments:**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Reset the score to zero when unmarking.
    * Pros: Ensures consistency by indicating the assignment is both "not submitted" and "not graded."
    * Cons: Users may need to re-enter scores if the unmark was accidental.

* Alternative 2: Retain the existing score when unmarking.
    * Pros: Allows re-marking without re-entering the score.
    * Cons: Could mislead users into thinking the assignment has been graded, even though it is marked as "not submitted."

#### Implementation

1. **UnmarkAssignmentCommandParser**
    - Parses the command input for unmarking an assignment, ensuring that `PREFIX_STUDENT_INDEX` and `PREFIX_ASSIGNMENT_INDEX` are present.
    - After tokenizing and validating the input, retrieves the values for `studentIndex` and `assignmentIndex` using `ParserUtil`. If parsing fails, a `ParseException` is thrown.
    - Returns a new `UnmarkAssignmentCommand` initialized with the parsed values.

2. **UnmarkAssignmentCommand**
    - **Execution Steps**:
        - Retrieves the list of students and validates `studentIndex` to confirm it is within bounds. If invalid, an exception is thrown.
        - Using `assignmentIndex`, retrieves the assignment from the selected studentâ€™s assignment list and verifies the index is valid.
        - Checks if the assignment is already unmarked; if so, an exception is thrown.
        - Updates the assignmentâ€™s status to "not submitted," resets the score to zero, and marks it as "not graded."
        - Returns a `CommandResult` object confirming the assignment was successfully unmarked.

    - **Error Handling**:
        - Throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_INVALID_STUDENT_DISPLAYED_INDEX` if `studentIndex` is invalid.
        - Throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_INVALID_ASSIGNMENT_INDEX` if `assignmentIndex` is invalid.
        - Throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_ALREADY_UNMARKED` if the assignment is already marked as "not submitted."

This approach provides clarity by resetting all grading-related information, reinforcing that the assignment is no longer in a submitted state.

### Editing an Assignment

#### Design Considerations
For the edit command, the team discussed whether the assignment's previous detailsâ€”such as submission status and gradingâ€”should be retained or reset. Ultimately, it was decided that executing an edit likely indicates the user made a mistake in the original assignment details. Therefore, to avoid potential inconsistencies, the edit command resets all fields, including submission status and grading, ensuring the assignment reflects the updated information accurately.

**Aspect: Handling previous submission and grading details during editing:**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Reset all fields of the assignment, including submission status and grading.
    * Pros: Safer, as it provides a clean slate for the assignment details, eliminating potential conflicts with prior states.
    * Cons: Users must re-enter grading and submission details if the edit was only intended to change other fields.

* Alternative 2: Retain submission and grading status.
    * Pros: Allows users to update only specific details without affecting submission or grading status.
    * Cons: Risk of creating inconsistencies if the user intended to fully reset the assignment information.

This approach ensures that edited assignments start fresh, with any previous grading or submission statuses removed.

#### Implementation

1. **EditAssignmentCommandParser**
    - This parser is responsible for interpreting the command input for editing an assignment. It ensures that the required prefixes for identifying the student (`PREFIX_STUDENT_INDEX`) and the assignment (`PREFIX_ASSIGNMENT_INDEX`) are present.
    - After tokenizing and validating the input, it retrieves the optional fields (e.g., `PREFIX_ASSIGNMENT_NAME` and `PREFIX_ASSIGNMENT_MAX_SCORE`) for editing and creates an `EditAssignmentDescriptor` object to encapsulate the new values.
    - If no fields for editing are provided, it throws a `ParseException` with `MESSAGE_NOT_EDITED`.
    - Returns a new `EditAssignmentCommand` initialized with `studentIndex`, `assignmentIndex`, and `editAssignmentDescriptor`.

2. **EditAssignmentCommand**
    - **Execution Steps**:
        - Retrieves the current list of students and validates `studentIndex` to ensure it is within bounds. If invalid, an exception is thrown.
        - Using `assignmentIndex`, retrieves the specified assignment from the studentâ€™s assignment list and confirms the index is valid.
        - Creates a new `Assignment` object with the edited values, ensuring that any fields not specified retain their original values from the current assignment.
        - Checks for duplicate assignments to prevent editing if the new assignment matches another existing assignment.
        - Updates the studentâ€™s assignment list with the edited assignment and refreshes the filtered student list in the model.
        - Returns a `CommandResult` object with a success message detailing the updated assignment.

    - **Error Handling**:
        - Throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_INVALID_STUDENT_DISPLAYED_INDEX` if `studentIndex` is invalid.
        - Throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_INVALID_ASSIGNMENT_INDEX` if `assignmentIndex` is invalid.
        - Throws a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_DUPLICATE_ASSIGNMENT` if the edited assignment would duplicate another existing assignment in the studentâ€™s list.

3. **EditAssignmentDescriptor**
    - Stores the details of the edited fields (name and max score) and provides methods to check if any field is edited.
    - Used by `EditAssignmentCommand` to create a new assignment with the updated values, ensuring that only specified fields are changed.

This approach enables flexible and targeted edits, while error handling ensures valid input and avoids duplicate assignments.


### Viewing a student's details
This `view_student` command is a feature that allows the user to expand and view all of a student's details in the details panel, based on the student's index.
Additional details such as a student's assignments and remarks, that are not visible in the list panel, will now also be visible in the details panel.

#### Design Considerations:
In order to select a student to be displayed on the detail's panel, the student has to be identified from the list of contacts.

**Aspect: Identifying the student to be displayed on the panel:**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Identify student by the student index.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, and less prone to Users making errors in command format.
    * Cons: The student index in the list may change every time the list is filtered, which may be confusing for the user as he has to check for the student index every time he calls this command.

* Alternative 2: Identify student by their name.
    * Pros: User will not have to check for the student index in the list every time he wants to call this command.
    * Cons: As TAchy allows multiple contacts to be saved with the same name, additional fields such as phone number will have to be used in conjunction with "name" in order to differentiate between them. This will make the implementation more complex.

#### Implementation
* LogicManager executes the command "view_student".
* LogicManager parses the command via AddressBookParser.
* AddressBookParser creates and delegates parsing to ViewStudentCommandParser.
* ViewStudentCommandParser creates an ViewStudentCommand object.
* ViewStudentCommand is returned to ViewStudentCommandParser and back to AddressBookParser.
* LogicManager then executes ViewStudentCommand, which interacts with the Model.
* ViewStudentCommand creates a CommandResult object.
* CommandResult is returned to ViewStudentCommand, which returns the result to LogicManager.
* The sequence concludes with the return to the caller from LogicManager.

### Adding a remark to a student
This `remark` command allows the user to add a remark for a specific student.
The user must specify the student's index from the displayed list, followed by the remark to be added.

#### Design Considerations:
In order to add a remark to a student, the user must provide a number representing the student's index and remark string to get attached to that selected student from the list.

**Aspect: Identifying the student to add a remark to:**
* Alternative 1 (current choice): Identify the student by their index.
    * Pros: Straightforward and easy to implement. Users only need to reference the index in the list to add a remark, which makes it less error-prone.
    * Cons: The student index may change every time the list is filtered, so the user has to check for the student index every time the user before calling this command.

* Alternative 2: Identify student by their name.
    * Pros: Users do not have to worry about filtered indexes, so the user does not have to check the list every time before calling this command.
    * Cons: Since TAchy allows multiple contacts with the same name, the system may encounter ambiguity when handling duplicate names, so additional fields are required to uniquely identify the contacts, which will require more typing.

#### Implementation
* LogicManager executes the command "remark".
* LogicManager parses the command via AddressBookParser.
* AddressBookParser creates and delegates parsing to RemarkCommandParser.
* RemarkCommandParser creates a RemarkCommand object.
* RemarkCommand is returned to RemarkCommandParser and back to AddressBookParser.
* LogicManager then executes RemarkCommand, which interacts with the Model.
* RemarkCommand creates a CommandResult object.
* CommandResult is returned to RemarkCommand, which returns the result to LogicManager.
* The sequence concludes with the return to the caller from LogicManager.
* This describes the flow of command execution, parsing, and interaction with the model.

### Planned Enhancements:
Team size: 5
1. **Update Result display box to enable wrapping and be of greater vertical length:** So that users do not need to scroll in order to read the result display box and will be able to see the full result if the result is too long to fit in the box.
2. **Make tag names wrap if it exceeds the UI display:** The current display of tag names results in them exceeding the UI display if they are too long. Although it can be mitigated by enlarging the window size, it relies on using the mouse, which is not CLI-friendly.
3. **Display student information in the window after the Add Student command:** The current implementation does not display the student information in the window after the Add Student command, unlike other commands like the Edit Student command. This should be fixed to maintain consistency.
4. **Display more accurate error messages for unexpected prefixes and '/'s:** The current implementation will display a ```Index should be a non-zero unsigned integer and cannot be blank``` error message for a command that contains prefixes or '/'s that are not expected e.g. ```edit_student si/1 r/math```. However, it should display the command's respective invalid command message to facilitate better understanding.
5. **Enable Edit Assignment Command to edit graded assignment without losing its submission status and score:** The current implementation of the Edit Assignment command will reset the assignment's submission status and score to default values if the assignment is already graded. This should be fixed to allow the user to edit the assignment without losing its submission status and score.
6. **Standardize the command success messages:** The current implementation of the command success messages is 
   inconsistent. Some commands like `edit_student` displays student details, while others like `view_student` do not.
   This should be standardized to ensure that users receive feedback in consistent formats.
7. **Allow for "/" in student names:** The current implementation does not allow for student names to contain "/", which isolates students who have them in their names. This should be fixed to allow for a wider range of valid names.
8. **Reject new students with the same Student Identifiers, but different capitalisation of email:** The current implementation allows for students with the same Student Identifiers but a different capitalisation of email to be added. This does not make sense as email are traditionally not case-sensitive. It should be fixed to allow better identification of users.
9. **Reject duplicate phone numbers and/or duplicate emails**: The current implementation only checks that new students added have a unique combination of student identifiers (name, email and phone number). This means that the current implementation allows for the addition of students with different names, but the same phone number/email. A more thorough implementation can instead prevent adding of students that have the exact same number or email.  

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

- Business/domain rules: Students cannot have the same Student Identifiers. If a tutor has 2 or more students with the same name, then different emails or phone fields must be used to distinguish students.
- Constraints: The system must be backward compatible with data produced by earlier versions of the system, The total project cost should be $0, The project is offered as a free service, TAs are only allowed to store up to 5 GB of data
- Technical requirements: The system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environment, The system should be compatible with Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.
- Performance requirements: The system should respond to user inputs within five seconds, The system should be able to handle a large number of students, classes, and assignments without degradation in performance, Data retrieval should not take longer than 2 seconds.
- Quality requirements: The system should be usable by a novice who has never used AB3 before, The system should have clear user documentation to guide users through its features, Intuitive error messages will be displayed to the user so that they know what is the correct method of using the system
- Process requirements: The project is expected to adhere to the milestones which are added every week
- Notes about project scope: The system is not required to integrate with third-party systems (e.g. Canvas). The system is not required to generate or print detailed reports of class performance or assignment scores. The system will only support English as the user interface language. The system will not be deployed on the cloud and will only run locally.
- Any other noteworthy points: The system must ensure data privacy by adhering to relevant data protection regulations. The system should not use any language or imagery that may be offensive to students or faculty members from different cultural backgrounds.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, MacOS
* **Private student detail**: A student detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **Teacher**: Interchangeable with Tutor. This app is meant for Private tutors who teach multiple students
* **Student Identifiers** : Student name, phone number, and email
