## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutorease/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutorease/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `contact delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutorease/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component" />

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`,  
`LessonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class  
which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutorease/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Lesson` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutorease/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("contact delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `contact delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteContactCommandParser` and `ContactCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, in this case `execute("contact delete 1)`, it is passed to an `TutorEaseParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the type of command. In this case, it is the `ContactCommandParser` as we are executing a command related to contacts. Commands related to lessons will use `LessonCommandParser`.
1. The `ContactCommandParser` will create the specific contact command parser corresponding to the execution. In this case, a `DeleteContactCommandParser` will be created to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object, specifically a `DeleteContactCommand` in this case, which is executed by the`LogicManager`.<br>
   (Note that `DeleteContactCommand` is a subclass of `ContactCommand` which is a subclass of `Command`)
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed, in this case, to delete a person.<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TutorEaseParser` class creates a `ContactCommandParser` or `LessonCommandParser` based on the first word that the tutor keys in, which creates `XYZContactCommandParser`(e.g. `AddContactCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommandParser`) and `XYZLessonCommandParser` (e.g. `AddLessonCommandParser`) respectively. `XYZContactCommandParser` and `XYZLessonCommandParser` use the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZContactCommand` or `XYZLessonCommand` object (e.g., `AddContactCommand`) which the `TutorEaseParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZContactCommandParser` and `XYZLessonCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the`Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

Extra Pointers about parsing:

* For basic one-word commands like `help`, `exit`, and `clear`, they are handled directly within the `parseCommand` function in `TutorEaseParser` without the need for a dedicated parser.
These simple commands are omitted in the Parser classes diagram to enhance clarity and reduce clutter.
* Various contact and lesson command parsers are represented as `XYZContactCommandParser` and `XYZLessonCommandParser`, respectively. 
However, their behaviour varies slightly depending on the function. For example, `ArgumentMultimap` is used exclusively in parsers for add, delete, and edit commands, 
while `ArgumentTokenizer` is only used in parsers for add and edit commands. Not specifying every parser reduces clutter and conveys the high-level message concisely.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutorease/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml"/>


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `TutorEase`, which `Person` references. This allows `TutorEase` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103-F11-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tutorease/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml"/>

The `Storage` component,

* can save contact data, lesson data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `TutorEaseStorage`, `LessonSchedule` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tutorease.address.commons` package.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

Team Size: 4

#### 1. **Unique Attributes and Relationship Modeling for Students and Guardians**
Recognizing the importance of capturing more details about different types of contacts, we plan to incorporate additional attributes for students, such as grade levels, subjects and exam dates.
To support clear organization, weâ€™ll also implement a tagging system that links each student to their respective guardian, making it easier to manage relationships and access relevant information at a glance.
In the event that a student does not have contact information, they will be required to be linked to a guardian, ensuring that there exist a way to contact the student.

#### 2. **Overlapping Lesson Time Handling**
We recognize the need for clarity around overlapping lesson scheduling. Options for managing overlaps will include:

* Allowing overlapping sessions for group lessons or pair lessons.
* Enabling you to customize settings for overlap permissions based on the type of lesson.

#### 3. **Enhanced Name Field Support**
To accommodate a more diverse range of names, such as names with commas, accented characters, hyphens, etc., we plan to update the application to allow names with these characters.
In the future, the system will support a wider variety of name formats, making it more inclusive and user-friendly.

Additionally, if extra whitespace is accidentally added between names (e.g., double space between first and last name), the system will show a warning to alert you of potential duplicate entries due to spacing inconsistencies.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4. **Past Lesson Management**
To enhance lesson organization, we plan to introduce features that clearly distinguish past lessons. This will include options to automatically hide completed lessons or display them in a different color for easy identification.
You will also be able to toggle the visibility of past lessons, allowing them to focus on upcoming schedules while still being able to reference completed sessions if needed.

#### 5. **Support for Decimal Places in Fees**
We have acknowledged that it might be possible to charge an odd number (ie $25) per lesson for an even number of hours (ie 2 hours), resulting in the fee per hour not being an integer.
To provide more flexibility in fee management, we plan to introduce support for decimal places in fee amounts.
This will allow you to input and manage fees with greater precision, catering to scenarios where fees are calculated to fractional values (e.g., for hourly rates or partial payments).

#### 6. **Support for More Screen Resolutions**
An example of this issue is when a Tutor creates a contact with a name, address, tag, and email that are longer than expected. Part of the UI will be cut off if the screen resolution is not big enough. To ensure that the application is accessible to users with a wide range of screen sizes, we plan to optimize the user interface for additional screen resolutions so that none of the elements are cut off or hidden from view, regardless of the screen size.

#### 7. **Allow integer values above 2,147,483,647**
Although it is highly unlikely that an integer value would exceed 2,147,483,647 under normal usage, the system currently only supports integer values up to 2,147,483,647. To accommodate larger values, we plan to update the system to allow for integer values above this limit. This will ensure that you can input and manage larger values without encountering any issues related to the integer limit.
