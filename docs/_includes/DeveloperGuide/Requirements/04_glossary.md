This Spleetwaise app is a _single-user_ application. Transactions are relative to <ins>_the user_</ins>.
- **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS

- **Transaction**: A Transaction represents a record of a financial interaction between <ins>_the user_</ins> and another party (another contact).
  - **Not Done** Transaction: By default, a newly created transaction is set as not done - _e.g._ if the transaction is added as `addTxn 1 amt/12.3 desc/John owes me for dinner`, this transaction is not done, John still owes <ins>_the user_</ins>. (The terms "undone" and "not done" may be used interchangeably in Spleetwaise)
